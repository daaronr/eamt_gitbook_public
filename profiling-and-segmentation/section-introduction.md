# Introduction ...

## Strategic considerations

* how to get more people to care about this (more donation to the most effective causes, more people caring about effective interventions and long term survival of humanity)
* How to get the "Einsteins" of the generation interested in this
* How do we introduce this to people? (that is what we have been working on in previous sections)
* Another question is WHO do we target -- how do we do market profiling (Not just what do we present, but who do we present this to)
* Most of the EAMT project has been on '_what_ do we present>'... now we consider '_whom_ do we present this to?'
