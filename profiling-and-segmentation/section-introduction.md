# Section introduction

Strategic

* how to get more people to care about this (more donation to the most effective causes, more people caring about effective interventions and long term survival of humanity)&#x20;
* How to get the "einsteins" of the generation interested in this
* How do we introduce this to people? (that is what we have been working on in previous sections)&#x20;
* Another question is WHO do we target -- how do we do market profiling (Not just what do we present, but who do we present this to)
* Most of the project has been what do we present not who do we present this to , but now we are focusing on this.&#x20;
