### Sentience institute

> Our Animals, Food and Technology (AFT) survey tracks attitudes towards animal farming and animal product alternatives in the US. In 2020, as in the 2017 and 2019 iterations, we found significant opposition to various aspects of the animal farming industry, with a majority of people reporting discomfort with the industry, and strong support for a range of quite radical policy changes, such as banning slaughterhouses. The trend in attitudes between 2017 and 2020 is relatively stable, though slightly negative (not statistically significant). Notably, the number of people who consider animal farming to be one of the most important social issues fell from 2017 to 2019, and remained at this lower level in 2020.
