NBER Working Paper (2019/2021), Dietmar Fehr, Johanna Mollerstrom, and Ricardo Perez-Truglia

* Attitudes towards global redistribution
* "De-biasing" intervention (how rich participants relative to Germans, how rich Germany is globally)

Tied to

> German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), a representative longitudinal study of German households. The SOEP contains an innovation sample (SOEP-IS) allowing researchers to implement tailor-made survey experiments.

> a two-year, face-to-face survey experiment on a representative sample of Germans. We measure how individuals form perceptions of their ranks in the national and global income distributions, and how those perceptions relate to their national and global policy preferences. We find that Germans systematically underestimate their true place in the world’s income distribution, but that correcting those misperceptions does not affect their support for policies related to global inequality.

_**Why might this be relevant:**_&#x20;

They ask about support for global redistribution, international aid institutions, globalization, immigration, and more, and have an incentivized giving choice.  These are (arguably) measures of support for some EA behaviors/attitudes.

I suspect that this data could be tied to a variety of rich (personality? demographic?) measures in the SOEP.  (RP slack discussion [here](https://rethinkpriorities.slack.com/archives/G01962YABHB/p1638923727273900?thread\_ts=1635802401.031800\&cid=G01962YABHB), I aim to incorporate this)


###  Further scoping, access, PhD partner

Thomas Ptashnik is a Psychology PhD student interested in working on this with us. He is using the SOEP-Core data and familiar with SEM/Latent variable methods


He notes:

> We can definitely access the Fehr data (and don't need to get their permission them to do so).

> If you want to get a better sense of the questions available to us, here's the link to the Fehr appendix that contains the survey items they created (starting at Appendix B on page 33).

> These items correspond to the SOEP-IS surveys, which can be found here (use item names, like Q132, to search quickly)

> These links also mention that individuals with preexisting data access can apply for expanded access. I have access to SOEP-core version 36 (1984-2020 surveys), so I can submit this request. However, if you want to analyze the data on your computer, I believe we will need to submit an additional request to add you to the data contract. Let me know if you want to do this. My advisor handled data access, so I will talk with her about revising our contract later this week.


> To add to the litany of links, here’s also info about the data I currently have access to. I imagine we’d exclusively use the individual questionnaire (and perhaps the household one for income info). If you click on the dropdown “Topics of SOEP-Core”, you can see every instrument that has been used since the inception of SOEP. http://companion.soep.de/Data%20Structure%20of%20SOEPcore/Raw%20Data.html#original-raw




## Who gives effectively? Unique characteristics of those who have taken the Giving What We Can Pledge

> we focus on individuals who have taken the Giving What We Can Pledge: a pledge to donate at least 10% of your lifetime income to effective charities. In a global survey (N = 536) we examine cognitive and personality traits in Giving What We Can donors and compare them to country-matched controls. Compared to controls, Giving What We Can donors were better at identifying fearful faces, and more morally expansive. They were higher in actively open-minded thinking, need for cognition, and two subscales of utilitarianism (impartial beneficence and instrumental harm), but lower in maximizing tendency (a tendency to search for an optimal outcome). We found no differences between Giving What We Can donors and the control sample for empathy and compassion, and results for social dominance orientation were inconsistent across analyses.&#x20;

## Tangential: 'Omnibus' lab survey at University of Exeter

* Includes real donation choice question(s), rich survey and psychometric data, including 'mind in the eyes' empathy judgements
* Students and nonstudents (local town population)
