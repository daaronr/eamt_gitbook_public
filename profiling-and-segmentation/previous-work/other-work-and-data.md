NBER Working Paper (2019/2021), Dietmar Fehr, Johanna Mollerstrom, and Ricardo Perez-Truglia

* Attitudes towards global redistribution
* "De-biasing" intervention (how rich participants relative to Germans, how rich Germany is globally)

Tied to

> German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), a representative longitudinal study of German households. The SOEP contains an innovation sample (SOEP-IS) allowing researchers to implement tailor-made survey experiments.

> a two-year, face-to-face survey experiment on a representative sample of Germans. We measure how individuals form perceptions of their ranks in the national and global income distributions, and how those perceptions relate to their national and global policy preferences. We find that Germans systematically underestimate their true place in the world’s income distribution, but that correcting those misperceptions does not affect their support for policies related to global inequality.

_**Why might this be relevant:**_

They ask about support for global redistribution, international aid institutions, globalization, immigration, and more, and have an incentivized giving choice. These are (arguably) measures of support for some EA behaviors/attitudes.

I suspect that this data could be tied to a variety of rich (personality? demographic?) measures in the SOEP. (RP slack discussion [here](https://rethinkpriorities.slack.com/archives/G01962YABHB/p1638923727273900?thread\_ts=1635802401.031800\&cid=G01962YABHB), I aim to incorporate this)

### Further scoping, access, PhD partner

Thomas Ptashnik is a Psychology PhD student interested in working on this with us. He is using the SOEP-Core data and familiar with SEM/Latent variable methods

He notes:

> We can definitely access the Fehr data (and don't need to get their permission them to do so). If you want to get a better sense of the questions available to us, [here's](https://data.nber.org/data-appendix/w26555/ONLINE%20APPENDIX%20-%20Your%20Place%20in%20the%20World%20-%20August2021.pdf) the link to the Fehr appendix that contains the survey items they created (starting at Appendix B on page 33).\

DR: Some interesting content (at a quick peek)

From 2017...

Q380: What you value in your work likerts ... includes "Having much influence" and "Socially responsible and important work"

Q160: Optimism/pessimism about the future

Q162: ... bunch of Likerts on "attitudes towards life and the future" (e.g., 'The options that I have in life are determined by social circumstances.')&#x20;

From 2019

... they seem to collect genetic data



#### 15 Dec 2021 notes Had a good meeting. I think this project has ‘legs’.

I think we might see positive responses to the Fehr et al questions and donation choices as ‘necessary but not sufficient' for people to become effective givers or even EAs. If (especially in spite of the de-biasing) people still don’t support international redistribution, international orgs, and don’t opt to give from the lottery earnings to the global poor person … I think they are very unlikely to be susceptible to an EA appeal. \
\
_But_, _as a check on this_, it might be good to try to ask these same questions on a sample of actual EA’s and effective givers, and a comparison group!).



I envision two related projects on the same data: 1. Building a 'portable' model for prediction to aid targeting and 2. Building a 'deeper' model to aid understanding

1. &#x20;I’m hoping that looking for predictors of (or ‘coherent factors explaining’) these responses in the SOEP data would prove useful for orgs like GWWC to consider ‘which groups to target in doing outreach’ (and perhaps especially ‘which groups to rule out’)&#x20;

* I hope we can do a sort of ‘leak-proof validated predictive ML model for this’
* perhaps especially relevant for the German/EU context&#x20;

2\.  An (exploratory model) to help understand key factors that might be driving EA-adjacent attitudes and behaviors, offering insight into ‘what drives people towards or away from this mindset’.

* Here we could engage the richer set of SOEP variables and consider latent factors



## Who gives effectively? Unique characteristics of those who have taken the Giving What We Can Pledge

> we focus on individuals who have taken the Giving What We Can Pledge: a pledge to donate at least 10% of your lifetime income to effective charities. In a global survey (N = 536) we examine cognitive and personality traits in Giving What We Can donors and compare them to country-matched controls. Compared to controls, Giving What We Can donors were better at identifying fearful faces, and more morally expansive. They were higher in actively open-minded thinking, need for cognition, and two subscales of utilitarianism (impartial beneficence and instrumental harm), but lower in maximizing tendency (a tendency to search for an optimal outcome). We found no differences between Giving What We Can donors and the control sample for empathy and compassion, and results for social dominance orientation were inconsistent across analyses.

## Tangential: 'Omnibus' lab survey at University of Exeter

* Includes real donation choice question(s), rich survey and psychometric data, including 'mind in the eyes' empathy judgements
* Students and nonstudents (local town population)
