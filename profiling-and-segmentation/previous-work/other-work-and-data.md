NBER Working Paper (2019/2021), Dietmar Fehr, Johanna Mollerstrom, and Ricardo Perez-Truglia

* Attitudes towards global redistribution
* "De-biasing" intervention (how rich participants relative to Germans, how rich Germany is globally)

Tied to

> German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), a representative longitudinal study of German households. The SOEP contains an innovation sample (SOEP-IS) allowing researchers to implement tailor-made survey experiments.

> a two-year, face-to-face survey experiment on a representative sample of Germans. We measure how individuals form perceptions of their ranks in the national and global income distributions, and how those perceptions relate to their national and global policy preferences. We find that Germans systematically underestimate their true place in the worldâ€™s income distribution, but that correcting those misperceptions does not affect their support for policies related to global inequality.

_**Why might this be relevant:**_&#x20;

They ask about support for global redistribution, international aid institutions, globalization, immigration, and more, and have an incentivized giving choice.  These are (arguably) measures of support for some EA behaviors/attitudes.

I suspect that this data could be tied to a variety of rich (personality? demographic?) measures in the SOEP.&#x20;





## Who gives effectively? Unique characteristics of those who have taken the Giving What We Can Pledge

> we focus on individuals who have taken the Giving What We Can Pledge: a pledge to donate at least 10% of your lifetime income to effective charities. In a global survey (N = 536) we examine cognitive and personality traits in Giving What We Can donors and compare them to country-matched controls. Compared to controls, Giving What We Can donors were better at identifying fearful faces, and more morally expansive. They were higher in actively open-minded thinking, need for cognition, and two subscales of utilitarianism (impartial beneficence and instrumental harm), but lower in maximizing tendency (a tendency to search for an optimal outcome). We found no differences between Giving What We Can donors and the control sample for empathy and compassion, and results for social dominance orientation were inconsistent across analyses.&#x20;

## Tangential: 'Omnibus' lab survey at University of Exeter

* Includes real donation choice question(s), rich survey and psychometric data, including 'mind in the eyes' empathy judgements
* Students and nonstudents (local town population)
