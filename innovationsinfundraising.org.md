# Innovationsinfundraising.org

Innovations in Fundraising was an academic impact project and resource. _innovationsinfundraising.org_ was hosted as an interactive Dokuwiki.  &#x20;

It aimed:

> To explain and promote practical fundraising innovations stemming from academic research, to encourage trials and experiments, to promote effective giving and encourage collaboration and knowledge-sharing.

A key resource was a linked interactive database of 1. relevant papers, and 2. relevant 'tools'. Our automation tools allowed us to update this content via an Airtable, integrating it into the formatted DokuWiki table.

The project is no longer being hosted. Please contact David Reinstein to request access to any of the resources (or the underlying Airtable).&#x20;

I (David Reinstein) took down innovationsinfundraising.org for several reasons including:

* I didn't have time and funding to keep it updated, and I didn't want this to 'crowd out' others' work
* Hosting costs (roughly $400 per year)&#x20;
* It was largely superceded (at least in my own work) by other resources and projects, including "EA Market Testing" (the present Gitbook, and linked resources)

_I would consider reviving this in the future, and would be happy to join it with other maintailed resources. Please contact me if you would like to pursue this._&#x20;
