Updates: Went through recent impact ratings (briefly picking charities, found some limitations: 

*     [ American Red Cross](https://www.charitynavigator.org/ein/530196605):  100 out of 100 impact rating

    * "$670 provides an additional year of healthy life to a blood transfusion patient." (Note this is based on US data) 
    * This seems implausible as an actual 'impact' of a $670 donation; it is not clearly considering the counterfactual
