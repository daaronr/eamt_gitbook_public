# Literature on animal advocacy messaging

DR: How people respond to animal advocacy ads and what appeals to them more? (This is for Jamie of AAC â€¦ an ad targeted mainly at people who already care about animals/animal careers)

Others added information about the health and environmental impacts of factory farming. Still others gave specific suggestions on how to eat less meat or discussed laws to improve how animals are treated on farms.

> There was **no clear trend showing which psychological strategies were most effective**, although many different strategies were employed. Tactics often employed descriptions of how eating meat is becoming less normal, the emotions of farm animals, individual victims of factory farming, comparisons between farm animals and pets, and specific suggestions for how to eat less meat.The journal-published version:\

DR: Thanks. But I guess this stuff was mainly trying to appeal to the general public. Jamie is putting out general ads on Facebook but they are trying to get people to consider pursuing animal advocacy careers, and to take on their mentorship. I think the group that is being targeted is rather different.

Anytthing in the above seems specifically relevant to this, like stuff trying to get people who are already interested in animals to pursue it more seriously?
