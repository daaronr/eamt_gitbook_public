## Achievements, progress, current plans

### 1. EA Marketing group

**Josh Lewis (NYU) and David Reinstein have:**

*   **Brought together**

    * **key players** from EA giving and pledge organizations (especially [**GWWC**](../contexts-and-environments-for-testing/gwwc/)**,** [**TLYCS**](../contexts-and-environments-for-testing/tlycs/)**,** and [**OftW**](../contexts-and-environments-for-testing/one-for-the-world/)**,** and consulting with [givewell.md](../contexts-and-environments-for-testing/other/givewell.md "mention") and others),
    * applied academics, and
    * marketing experts.

    **Our team** is listed [HERE](../organization-and-overview/our-team-and-resources/). We have held a number of small-group meetings, and we are preparing for our third general meeting -- see [#meeting-agendas](../tip-o-the-spear.md#meeting-agendas "mention"))
* Created shared space ([HERE](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-MfFk4CTSGwVOPkwnRgx/s/-Mf8cHxdwePMZXRTKnEE/); i.e., the present context, a wiki-style 'Gitbook') to coordinate our plans, resources, and insights (as well as a Slack group and an [Airtable](broken-reference) for structured content).
* Pushing forward and assisting **several marketing trials, some of which are underway** (including some with data and results; see '[tip-o-the-spear](../tip-o-the-spear.md)' and links to preliminary results);
  * e.g., evidence from GWWC trial <mark style="background-color:yellow;">suggesting '</mark>[<mark style="background-color:yellow;">too many options/try-giving option may reduce take-up'</mark>](broken-reference)
  * <mark style="background-color:yellow;">e.g., OftW ran a</mark> [pre-giving-tuesday-email-split-test](../contexts-and-environments-for-testing/one-for-the-world/pre-giving-tuesday-email-split-test/ "mention"), we're helping to oversee/analyze. This (perhaps uniquely) considers the presentation of _emotional versus impact_ information for EA-aligned/adjacent donors. (Note that [Will MacAskill has expressed interest](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JVy1uK1x5vCAJTwwCJdUPvYAZBJeLBpfEMY9Tqx1-MY/edit#) in testing this particular framing comparison.) _(Update 2-2022: appears underpowered given low 'upsell' donation rate; following up)_
* _**Current push**_: run trials and experiments for 'quick wins and proofs-of-concept' while working towards building structure and resources for continuous systematic marketing, testing, and sharing insights.
  * **My key roles** include advising on designs and organizing and sharing results and analysis to avoid 'lost threads' (see [trial-reporting-template](../organization-and-overview/trial-reporting-template/ "mention"))
*   _**Update**_** 9 Feb 2022:** Volunteer (applying for funding for) Erin Morrissey to be a project management and research assistant;  aiming to put 20 hours/week into this. Proposal [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/149dfTQNc11Eg-4yML27nre0anJoA-1EmQ7SmoYWbjSM/edit?usp=sharing), Erin is writing it up into a grant application&#x20;



### 2. "[Impact of impact information](../contexts-and-environments-for-testing/charities-fundraisers-and-impact-information/)" experiments and synthesis

#### [ICRC](../contexts-and-environments-for-testing/charities-fundraisers-and-impact-information/icrc-quick-overview-+.md) experiment (with Jan Schmitz and Deborah Kistler)

_Background_: We are working with ICRC, a Switzerland-based individual development association on a series of large-scale field trials.

Our experiment involving 'cost per impact' information has come back. The results (see [linked preview](../contexts-and-environments-for-testing/charities-fundraisers-and-impact-information/icrc-quick-overview-+.md)) **suggest 'near-zero and tightly bounded impact of the cost-per-impact information'.** This is generally **consistent with previous work (but this is under-reported in the literature),** including the [Karlan and Wood (2017)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214804316300490?via%3Dihub) experiment at Freedom From Hunger, my [2018 and 2019 experiments with Catholic Relief Services](https://daaronr.github.io/dualprocess/donor-voice-questions-and-tests.html#comparison-of-posterior-probabilities), and other small-scale experiments [(Reinstein and Bergh, 2020)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1948550619893968?casa\_token=LHG5-s5teJYAAAAA%3AFpnPvCaoS94ADEvRt772GtOEHyhfSWAbWoboSArW\_WZ13s2AACbD6Ty\_Z07M6UhPqC\_ROWKYV1A).

_My next steps_: Write up these results specifically, and [in synthesis (meta-analysis) with the previous evidence](https://daaronr.github.io/dualprocess/index.html#raises-questions). We will 'bound the effect of cost-per-impact information' on donation incidence and average amount, and consider how it informs effective charities and fundraisers.

_Updates:_ Additional evidence to incorporate from Karlan/Kassirer very large-scale field experiment in a video-gaming context



### 3. Just Giving 'seed pages' trial:

Purpose: Investigate 'impact of early contributions (and messages)' to inform 'whether EAs should donate on social media'.

_This text updated_ 9 Feb 2022

\[Placeholder link: [social-influence-justgiving.md](../contexts-and-environments-for-testing/charities-fundraisers-and-impact-information/social-influence-justgiving.md "mention")]

* Scoped out feasible design and power calculations for small-stakes pilot and later 'effectiveness trial'; sufficient pages exist.&#x20;
  * Conversations and advising from Dillon Bowen on adaptive design, reinforcement and Bayesian learning extensions
* Worked with Oska Fentem (Bristol MRes) and Toby Jolly (UK Cabinet), built API tool to pull down relevant lists of ongoing fundraisers
* Built 'donation-seeding bot' with Peter Roensby -- tested to work, needs stress-testing and integration with API tool. Gained (Linode) server access to maintain this.&#x20;
* Aim to run self-funded pilot for early to mid 2022  (delayed); possible larger run in 2022-23 giving season

_My next steps:_ Tech steps given in project board [here](https://github.com/daaronr/sponsorship\_design\_analysis/projects/1), mainly linking API and donation seeding bot.  Reprise outline, pre-registration, power analysis. Run PoC (but also informative) pilots (first 'small seeds' for mainstream charities, then 'large and small seeds' for effective charities)

### 4. [Facebook fundraising trial](reinstein-longview-psychology-of-effective-giving-project.md#4.-facebook-fundraising-trial-with-paul-smeets-dean-karlan-and-janek-kretschmer) (with Paul Smeets, Dean Karlan, and Janek Kretschmer)

**Trial incentivizing FB users to start birthday fundraisers for effective charities,** investigating how this behavior (and amounts raised) **responds to effectiveness and rating information** and presentation. Dean Karlan has allocated 100k USD funding for supporting donation incentives and tech support for this.

_This text updated_ 9 Feb 2022

* Tech delays: Failed to obtain FB Fundraiser API access; thus revised design, but we may be able to work _with_ Facebook on this, and API access is on the table again; we now have a partner co-author within Facebook
* meanwhile, we have a design that does not require API access
* Hired Peter Roensby (EA aligned developer), whom we are working with to finish the
  * build of web interface for trial encouraging birthday fundraisers (85% done 9 Feb 202)
  * bot to collect data on fundraisers
* Aim to run PoC pilot by end of Februaru 2022

_My next steps:_ Finalizing and checking web site, queing advertisements and their parameters, funding and running  Pilot

### 5. Barriers synthesis

[Web-resource (bookdown): Increasing effective charitable giving: The puzzle, what we know, what we need to know next](https://daaronr.github.io/ea\_giving\_barriers/index.html)

* Updates and additions, some reorganization.
* particularly incorporating recent syntheses (Caviola et al "The many obstacles to effective giving", Noetel et al "What Works..."; [Jaeger and Vugt "Psychological Barriers..." ](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352250X21001779))
  * In light of these papers, renewed focus on '_careful_ evidence-base _on key operationalized claims_' over broad 'literature review'

_Update_ 9 Feb 2022: New researcher on board -- Annabel Rayner has a health economics and meta-analysis background, aiming to put 10-15 hours/week into this project

### 6. Other

Additional content in EA Survey donation report [informs 'do GWWC people fulfill pledges?](https://rethinkpriorities.github.io/ea\_data\_public/eas\_donations.html#plan-actual)'. This work straddles my RP and grant work; I included some additional content and analysis over and above RP mandate on this.
