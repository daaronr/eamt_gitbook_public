## Achievements, progress, current plans

### 1. EA Marketing group

**Josh Lewis (NYU) and David Reinstein have:**

*   **Brought together**

    * **key players** from EA giving and pledge organizations (especially [**GWWC**](../contexts-and-environments-for-testing/gwwc/)**,** [**TLYCS**](../contexts-and-environments-for-testing/tlycs/)**,** and [**OftW**](../contexts-and-environments-for-testing/one-for-the-world/)**,** and consulting with [givewell.md](../contexts-and-environments-for-testing/other/givewell.md "mention") and others),
    * applied academics, and
    * marketing experts.

    **Our team** is listed [HERE](../organization-and-overview/our-team-and-resources/). We have held a number of small-group meetings, sharing our plans and advice. First '[monthly general meeting](../tip-o-the-spear.md#meeting-agendas)': scheduled for 1 Dec. 2021 (see [#meeting-agendas](../tip-o-the-spear.md#meeting-agendas "mention"))
* Created shared space ([HERE](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-MfFk4CTSGwVOPkwnRgx/s/-Mf8cHxdwePMZXRTKnEE/); i.e., the present context, a wiki-style 'Gitbook') to coordinate our plans, resources, and insights (as well as a Slack group and an [Airtable](../organization-and-overview/how-this-gitbook-works/other-tech.md#airtable) for structured content).
* Worked to push forward and encourage **several marketing trials, some of which are underway** (including some with data and results; see '[tip-o-the-spear](../tip-o-the-spear.md)' and links to preliminary results);
  * e.g., evidence from GWWC trial <mark style="background-color:yellow;">suggesting '</mark>[<mark style="background-color:yellow;">too many options/try-giving option may reduce take-up'</mark>](../contexts-and-environments-for-testing/gwwc/pledge-page-options-trial.md#basic-results-outcomes)
  * <mark style="background-color:yellow;">e.g., OftW is currently running a</mark> [pre-giving-tuesday-email-split-test](../contexts-and-environments-for-testing/one-for-the-world/pre-giving-tuesday-email-split-test/ "mention"), we're helping to oversee/analyze. This (perhaps uniquely) considers the presentation of _emotional versus impact_ information for EA-aligned/adjacent donors. (Note that [Will MacAskill has expressed interest](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JVy1uK1x5vCAJTwwCJdUPvYAZBJeLBpfEMY9Tqx1-MY/edit#) in testing this particular framing comparison.)
* _**Current push**_: run trials and experiments for 'quick wins and proofs-of-concept' while working towards building structure and resources for continuous systematic marketing, testing, and sharing insights.
  * **My key roles** include advising on designs (see [broken-reference](broken-reference/ "mention")) and organizing and sharing results and analysis to avoid 'lost threads' (see [trial-reporting-template](../contexts-and-environments-for-testing/trial-reporting-template/ "mention"))

### 2. "[Impact of impact information](../contexts-and-environments-for-testing/charities-fundraisers-and-impact-information/)" experiments and synthesis

#### [ICRC](../contexts-and-environments-for-testing/charities-fundraisers-and-impact-information/icrc-quick-overview-+.md) experiment (with Jan Schmitz and Deborah Kistler)

_Background_: We are working with ICRC, a Switzerland-based individual development association on a series of large-scale field trials.

Our experiment involving 'cost per impact' information has come back. The results (see [linked preview](../contexts-and-environments-for-testing/charities-fundraisers-and-impact-information/icrc-quick-overview-+.md)) **suggest 'near-zero and tightly bounded impact of the cost-per-impact information'.** This is generally **consistent with previous work (but this is under-reported in the literature),** including the [Karlan and Wood (2017)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214804316300490?via%3Dihub) experiment at Freedom From Hunger, my [2018 and 2019 experiments with Catholic Relief Services](https://daaronr.github.io/dualprocess/donor-voice-questions-and-tests.html#comparison-of-posterior-probabilities), and other small-scale experiments [(Reinstein and Bergh, 2020)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1948550619893968?casa\_token=LHG5-s5teJYAAAAA%3AFpnPvCaoS94ADEvRt772GtOEHyhfSWAbWoboSArW\_WZ13s2AACbD6Ty\_Z07M6UhPqC\_ROWKYV1A).

_My next steps_: Write up these results specifically, and [in synthesis (meta-analysis) with the previous evidence](https://daaronr.github.io/dualprocess/index.html#raises-questions). We will 'bound the effect of cost-per-impact information' on donation incidence and average amount, and consider how it informs effective charities and fundraisers.

### 3. Just Giving 'seed pages' trial:

Purpose: Investigate 'impact of early contributions (and messages)' to inform 'whether EAs should donate on social media'.

\[Placeholder link: [social-influence-justgiving.md](../contexts-and-environments-for-testing/charities-fundraisers-and-impact-information/social-influence-justgiving.md "mention")]

* Scoped out feasible design and power calculations for small-stakes pilot and later 'effectiveness trial'; sufficient pages exist.
* Worked with Oska Fentem (Bristol MRes); built 'donation-seeding bot'; needs stress-testing.
* Aim to run self-funded pilot for upcoming 2020-21 giving season.
* Conversations and advising from Dillon Bowen on adaptive design, reinforcement and Bayesian learning extensions

_My next steps:_ Gaining server access and 'tech support' to enable this automation, finish outlining and re-registering, run PoC (but also informative) pilots (first 'small seeds' for mainstream charities, then 'large and small seeds' for effective charities)

### 4. [Facebook fundraising trial](reinstein-longview-psychology-of-effective-giving-project.md#4.-facebook-fundraising-trial-with-paul-smeets-dean-karlan-and-janek-kretschmer) (with Paul Smeets, Dean Karlan, and Janek Kretschmer)

**Trial incentivizing FB users to start birthday fundraisers for effective charities,** investigating how this behavior (and amounts raised) **responds to effectiveness and rating information** and presentation. Dean Karlan has allocated 100k USD funding for supporting donation incentives and tech support for this.

* Tech delays: Failed to obtain FB Fundraiser API access; thus revised design
  * However, we may be able to work _with_ Facebook on this, and API access is on the table again; we now have a partner co-author within Facebook
*   Hiring another web dev to build this and support our automation (suitable person identified and interviewed, an EA-aligned web developer, finalizing details)

    * Aim to run in early (Feb.?) 2022

    _My next steps:_ finalizing 'state of FB support and API access', hiring developer (1-2 weeks design work for simple design), running POC

### 5. Barriers synthesis

[Web-resource (bookdown): Increasing effective charitable giving: The puzzle, what we know, what we need to know next](https://daaronr.github.io/ea\_giving\_barriers/index.html)

* Updates and additions, some reorganization.
* particularly incorporating recent syntheses (Caviola et al "The many obstacles to effective giving", Noetel et al "What Works..."; [Jaeger and Vugt "Psychological Barriers..." ](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352250X21001779))
  * In light of these papers, renewed focus on '_careful_ e\_vidence-base\_ _on key operationalized claims_' over broad 'literature review'

### 6. Other

Additional content in EA Survey donation report [informs 'do GWWC people fulfill pledges?](https://rethinkpriorities.github.io/ea\_data\_public/eas\_donations.html#plan-actual)'. This work straddles my RP and grant work; I included some additional content and analysis over and above RP mandate on this.
