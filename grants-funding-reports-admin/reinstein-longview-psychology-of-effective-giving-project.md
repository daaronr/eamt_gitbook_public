# Reinstein/Longview "psychology of effective giving" project

## Achievements, progress, current plans

### 1. EA Marketing group

**Josh Lewis (NYU) and David Reinstein have:**

*   Brought together

    * key players from EA giving and pledge organizations (especially GWWC, TLYCS, and OftW),
    * applied academics, and
    * marketing experts.

    Our team is listed [HERE](../organization-and-overview/our-team-and-resources/). We have held regular meetings, sharing our plans and advice.
* Created a shared space ([HERE](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-MfFk4CTSGwVOPkwnRgx/s/-Mf8cHxdwePMZXRTKnEE/); i.e., the present context, a wiki-style gitbook) to coordinate our plans, resources, and insights (as well as a Slack group and an airtable for structured content
* Worked to push forward and encourage several marketing trials, some of which are underway (some even have data that we are analyzing; see '[tip-o-the-spear](../tip-o-the-spear.md)' within the (current) Gitbook)
* Current push: run trials and experiments for 'quick wins and Proofs of Concept' while working towards building structure and resources for continuous systematic marketing, testing, and sharing insights

### 2. "Impact of impact information" experiments and synthesis

#### ICRC experiment (with Jan Schmitz and Deborah Kistler)

Background: We are working with ICRC, a Switzerland-based individual development association on a series of large-scale field trials.

Our experiment involving 'cost per impact' information has come back. The results suggest 'near-zero and tightly bounded impact of the cost-per-impact information'. This is generally consistent with previous work, including the  [Karlan and Wood (2017)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214804316300490?via%3Dihub) experiment at Freedom From Hunger, my [2018 and 2019 experiments with Catholic Relief Services](https://daaronr.github.io/dualprocess/donor-voice-questions-and-tests.html#comparison-of-posterior-probabilities), and other small-scale experiments [(Reinstein and Bergh, 2020)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1948550619893968?casa\_token=LHG5-s5teJYAAAAA%3AFpnPvCaoS94ADEvRt772GtOEHyhfSWAbWoboSArW\_WZ13s2AACbD6Ty\_Z07M6UhPqC\_ROWKYV1A).

_My next steps_: To write up these results in particular, and in synthesis (meta-analysis) with the previous evidence. We eill bound the effect of cost-per-impact information, and consider how it informs effective charities and fundraisers.

### 3. Just Giving 'seed pages' trial:

Purpose: Investigate 'impact of early contributions (and messages)' to inform 'whether EAs should donate on social media'.

* Scoped out feasible design and power calculations for small-stakes pilot and later 'effectiveness trial'; sufficient pages exist.
* Worked with Oska Fentem (Bristol MRes) to build 'donation seeding bot'; works but needs stress-testing.
* Aim to run self-funded pilot for upcoming 2020-21 giving season.
* Conversations and advising from Dillon Bowen on adaptive design, reinforcement and Bayesian learning extensions

### 4. Facebook fundraising trial (with Paul Smeets, Dean Karlan, and Janek Kretschmer)

Rem: Trial incentivizing FB users to start birthday fundraisers for effective charities, investigating how this behavior (and amounts raised) responds to effectiveness and rating information and presentation. Dean Karlan has allocated 100k USD funding for supporting donation incentives and tech support for this.

* Some tech delays: Failed to obtain FB Fundraiser API access, thus revised project design
  * However, we may be able to work _with_ Facebook on this, and API access is on the table again; we now have a partner co-author within Facebook
* Hiring another web dev to build this and support our automation (suitable person identified and interviewed, an EA-aligned web developer, finalizing details)
  * Aim to run in early 2022

### 5. Barriers synthesis

[Web-resource (bookdown): Increasing effective charitable giving: The puzzle, what we know, what we need to know next](https://daaronr.github.io/ea\_giving\_barriers/index.html)

* Some updates and additions
* particularly incorporating recent syntheses (Caviola et al "The many obstacles to effective giving", Noetel et al "What Works..."; [Jaeger and Vugt "Psychological Barriers..." ](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352250X21001779) )
* Watch [this space](https://daaronr.github.io/ea\_giving\_barriers/index.html) -- planning major updates in next few weeks

### 6. Other

* Additional content in EA Survey donation report [informs 'do GWWC people fulfill pledges?](https://rethinkpriorities.github.io/ea\_data\_public/eas\_donations.html#plan-actual)'. This work straddles my RP and grant work; I included some additional content and analysis over and above RP mandate on this.
