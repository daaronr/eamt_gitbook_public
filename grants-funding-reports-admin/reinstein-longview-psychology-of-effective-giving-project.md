## Achievements, progress, current plans

### 1. EA Marketing group

**Josh Lewis (NYU) and David Reinstein have**&#x20;

**... Brought together key players** from EA giving and pledge organizations, especially [80k](../contexts-and-environments-for-testing/80000-hours/), [**GWWC**](../contexts-and-environments-for-testing/gwwc/)**,** [**TLYCS**](../contexts-and-environments-for-testing/tlycs/)**,** and [**OftW**](../contexts-and-environments-for-testing/one-for-the-world/)**,** consulting with [givewell.md](../contexts-and-environments-for-testing/other/givewell.md "mention") and [Others](../contexts-and-environments-for-testing/other/) ,&#x20;

... as well as applied academics, and marketing experts. **Our team** is listed [HERE](../our-team-and-resources.md). We have held a number of small-group meetings, and we are preparing for our third general meeting -- see [#meeting-agendas](../tip-o-the-spear.md#meeting-agendas "mention"))

**... Created a** shared space ([HERE](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-MfFk4CTSGwVOPkwnRgx/s/-Mf8cHxdwePMZXRTKnEE/); i.e., the present context, a private wiki-style 'Gitbook') to coordinate our plans, resources, and insights (as well as a Slack group and an [Airtable](broken-reference) for structured content),&#x20;

... while building with a parallel [Public](https://effective-giving-marketing.gitbook.io/untitled/) page for sharing insights and tools with the general EA community (other than sensitive content and ongoing trials )



**Pushed forward, assisted, and documented** **a set of marketing trials,** some underway and some complete, with insights, including...

[gwwc](../contexts-and-environments-for-testing/gwwc/ "mention"):

* GWWC evidence from a 'Facebook ad/Giving Guide' trial (with meaningful 'email signups') with insights ([Gdoc link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FfrXhD1YAIjrATy9PR6ScP20NMQa82sd80YvMb62iUQ/edit#heading=h.zex9e5t56rt)) about&#x20;
  * cost per email signup (as low as $8),&#x20;
  * most/least promising messages (best: “Only 3% of people give effectively”, worst: "GWWC has helped 6000+ people"),
  * most promising audiences ('lookalike' and 'animal rights' best; little 'per-dollar' benefit from demographic targeting)&#x20;
* Evidence from GWWC pledge-page design trial <mark style="background-color:yellow;">suggesting '</mark>[<mark style="background-color:yellow;">too many options/try-giving option may reduce take-up'</mark>](broken-reference)

<mark style="background-color:yellow;"></mark>[one-for-the-world](../contexts-and-environments-for-testing/one-for-the-world/ "mention")<mark style="background-color:yellow;">:</mark>

*   &#x20;[pre-giving-tuesday-email-split-test](../contexts-and-environments-for-testing/one-for-the-world/pre-giving-tuesday-email-split-test/ "mention"): This (perhaps uniquely) considers the presentation of _emotional versus impact_ information for EA-aligned/adjacent donors. (Note that [Will MacAskill has expressed interest](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JVy1uK1x5vCAJTwwCJdUPvYAZBJeLBpfEMY9Tqx1-MY/edit#) in testing this particular framing comparison.)  _Preliminary results (_still needs updating for newer data)_:_

    * Overall low donation response to 'upsell campaign'
    * Can rule out a large difference (of 2.5x incidence or more), otherwise underpowered



[tlycs](../contexts-and-environments-for-testing/tlycs/ "mention")

* [advisor-signup-portland](../contexts-and-environments-for-testing/tlycs/advisor-signup-portland/ "mention"):  YouTube ads targeted the top-10% income households in Portland, advertising 'donation advisors'. Simple results...
  * Very few signups for the 'concierge advising service'
  * Estimated $32.4 cost per unique user click (year-on-year difference-in-difference from comparison cities)
    * Estimates from Portland YoY = $24.69, absolute lower bound $13.07 &#x20;



_****_

_**Current pushes and updates**_:

* **Erin Morrissey **_**joined** as a_ project management and research assistant for  20 hours/week, with a heavy emphasis on improving internal and external communications.  She is currently NYU-funded and is applying for [EAIF funds to be Ops+RA](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aLiwVnV724ggnS6zSCRixb7stVGOcCosdqdYo0BojL4/edit). Her work will enable faster and more organized follow-through and communication, and help our team stay active, focused, and motivated.
* **Further analysis** of above data and careful and **clear sharing of results,** both internally, in the public gitbook (e.g., the [reporting in progress here](https://effective-giving-marketing.gitbook.io/untitled/contexts-environments-plans-tests/gwwc/pledge-page-options-trial)), and (coming soon, we hope) on the EA Forum and other places, including some aiming at academic feedback.
* Further trials and experiments for 'quick wins and proofs-of-concept'; good progress on getting people to carefully document using the [trial-reporting-template](../processes-and-procedures/trial-reporting-template/ "mention")
* **Build structure and resources** for continuous systematic marketing, testing, and sharing insights.
* Working on "forking and partially **outsourcing" the** [**marketing implementation**](../core-knowledge-base/marketing-implementation-and-practical-tips/) ("procedures and received-wisdom best practice") aspect of the project
  * JS Winchell has an EAIF grant to explore an 'EA digital marketing agency'; their work should feedback into our knowledge base (including the Gitbook) and free up  bandwidth for our quantitative and social science researchers to 'focus on the analysis'

### 2. "[Impact of impact information](../contexts-and-environments-for-testing/charities-fundraisers-and-impact-information/)" experiments and synthesis

#### [ICRC](../contexts-and-environments-for-testing/charities-fundraisers-and-impact-information/icrc-quick-overview-+.md) experiment (with Jan Schmitz and Deborah Kistler)

_Background_: We are working with ICRC, a Switzerland-based individual development association on a series of large-scale field trials.

Our first large trial involved 'cost per impact' information. The results (see [linked preview](../contexts-and-environments-for-testing/charities-fundraisers-and-impact-information/icrc-quick-overview-+.md)) **suggest 'near-zero and tightly bounded impact of the cost-per-impact information'.** This is generally consistent with previous work **** (but  under-reported in the literature)**,** including the [Karlan and Wood (2017)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214804316300490?via%3Dihub) experiment at Freedom From Hunger, my [2018 and 2019 experiments with Catholic Relief Services](https://daaronr.github.io/dualprocess/donor-voice-questions-and-tests.html#comparison-of-posterior-probabilities), and other small-scale experiments [(Reinstein and Bergh, 2020)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1948550619893968?casa\_token=LHG5-s5teJYAAAAA%3AFpnPvCaoS94ADEvRt772GtOEHyhfSWAbWoboSArW\_WZ13s2AACbD6Ty\_Z07M6UhPqC\_ROWKYV1A). &#x20;

(Other, less EA-relevant results that 'suggested donation amounts' have an impact on donations, which cluster around these amounts. As in previous work, larger suggested donations lead to lower incidence but higher donations conditional on incidence, with ambiguous and contextual net effects.)

_Next steps_: Working with coauthors to write these results up specifically, and [in synthesis (meta-analysis) with the previous evidence](https://daaronr.github.io/dualprocess/index.html#raises-questions). We will 'bound the effect of cost-per-impact information' on donation incidence and average amount, and consider how it informs effective charities and fundraisers.

_Updates:_&#x20;

* Additional evidence to incorporate from Karlan/Kassirer very large-scale field experiment in a video-gaming context
* Planning followup (April) experiment with ICRC, which may explore different ways of framing the quantitative impact information &#x20;



### 3. Just Giving 'seed pages' trial:

Purpose: Investigate 'impact of early contributions (and messages)' to inform 'whether EAs should donate on social media'.

_This text updated_ 9 Feb 2022

\[Placeholder link: [social-influence-justgiving.md](../contexts-and-environments-for-testing/charities-fundraisers-and-impact-information/social-influence-justgiving.md "mention")]

* Scoped out feasible design and power calculations for small-stakes pilot and later 'effectiveness trial'; sufficient pages exist.&#x20;
  * Conversations and advising from Dillon Bowen on adaptive design, reinforcement and Bayesian learning extensions
* Worked with Oska Fentem (Bristol MRes) and Toby Jolly (UK Cabinet), built API tool to pull down relevant lists of ongoing fundraisers
* Built 'donation-seeding bot' with Peter Roensby -- tested to work, needs stress-testing and integration with API tool. Gained (Linode) server access to maintain this.&#x20;
* Aim to run self-funded pilot for early to mid 2022  (delayed); possible larger run in 2022-23 giving season

_Next steps:_ Tech steps given in project board [here](https://github.com/daaronr/sponsorship\_design\_analysis/projects/1), mainly linking API and donation seeding bot.  Tech is mostly complete, but needs pre-testing and some further power calculations.  Reprise outline, pre-registration, power analysis. Run PoC (but also informative) pilots (first 'small seeds' for mainstream charities, then 'large and small seeds' for effective charities)

### 4. [Facebook fundraising trial](reinstein-longview-psychology-of-effective-giving-project.md#4.-facebook-fundraising-trial-with-paul-smeets-dean-karlan-and-janek-kretschmer) (with Paul Smeets, Dean Karlan, and Janek Kretschmer)

**Trial incentivizing FB users to start birthday fundraisers for effective charities,** investigating how this behavior (and amounts raised) **responds to effectiveness and rating information** and presentation. Dean Karlan has allocated 100k USD funding for supporting donation incentives and tech support for this.

_This text updated_ 9 Feb 2022

* Tech delays: Failed to obtain FB Fundraiser API access; thus revised design, but we may be able to work _with_ Facebook on this, and API access is on the table again; we now have a partner co-author within Facebook
* meanwhile, we have a design that does not require API access
* Hired Peter Roensby (EA aligned developer), whom we are working with to finish the
  * build of web interface for trial encouraging birthday fundraisers (85% done 9 Feb 202)
  * bot to collect data on fundraisers
* Aim to run PoC pilot by end of Februaru 2022

_My next steps:_ Finalizing and checking web site, queing advertisements and their parameters, funding and running  Pilot

### 5. Barriers synthesis

[Web-resource (bookdown): Increasing effective charitable giving: The puzzle, what we know, what we need to know next](https://daaronr.github.io/ea\_giving\_barriers/index.html)

* Updates and additions, some reorganization.
* particularly incorporating recent syntheses (Caviola et al "The many obstacles to effective giving", Noetel et al "What Works..."; [Jaeger and Vugt "Psychological Barriers..." ](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352250X21001779))
  * In light of these papers, renewed focus on '_careful_ evidence-base _on key operationalized claims_' over broad 'literature review'

_Update_ 9 Feb 2022: New researcher on board -- Annabel Rayner has a health economics and meta-analysis background, aiming to put 10-15 hours/week into this project

### 6. Other

Additional content in EA Survey donation report [informs 'do GWWC people fulfill pledges?](https://rethinkpriorities.github.io/ea\_data\_public/eas\_donations.html#plan-actual)'. This work straddles my RP and grant work; I included some additional content and analysis over and above RP mandate on this.
