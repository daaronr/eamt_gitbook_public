# Reinstein/Longview "psychology of effective giving"

## Second grant (May 2022)

In a 25 April Longview (Kit Harris) has agreed to&#x20;

> “...Recommend a grant of $XXX   … bare-bones grant to fund you for 6 months to become really helpful to orgs which cause people to become EAs (not just donors).
>
> ...
>
> If your work does become really helpful to orgs which cause people to become EAs, we’d likely recommend a grant to give you a larger annual budget for up to 2 years. As above, I think this would likely require a fairly substantial reprioritisation of types of work.

I (David Reinstein) have consulted with my managers at Rethink Priorities and with several partner organizations, and I decided to accept this grant (pending a few administrative things).&#x20;

I provide a Google Doc discussing my [revised plans HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w9kUiJguWZx4EIvGBd7l0qMTJHWdlHV5z-pvKcdNPOA/edit); I will liaise (once again) with Kit Harris on this.  (This Gdoc is currently private but I aim to put some bullet points below)

## Achievements, progress, current plans

### 1. EA Market Testing (EAMT) team

### 2. "[Impact of impact information](../contexts-and-environments-for-testing/charities-fundraisers-and-impact-information/)" experiments and synthesis

<details>

<summary>ICRC experiment (with Jan Schmitz and Deborah Kistler); updates</summary>

_Background_: We are working with ICRC, a Switzerland-based individual development association on a series of large-scale field trials.

Our first large trial involved 'cost per impact' information. The results (see [linked preview](../contexts-and-environments-for-testing/charities-fundraisers-and-impact-information/icrc-quick-overview-+.md)) **suggest 'near-zero and tightly bounded impact of the cost-per-impact information'.** This is generally consistent with previous work \*\*\*\* (but under-reported in the literature)**,** including the [Karlan and Wood (2017)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214804316300490?via%3Dihub) experiment at Freedom From Hunger, my [2018 and 2019 experiments with Catholic Relief Services](https://daaronr.github.io/dualprocess/donor-voice-questions-and-tests.html#comparison-of-posterior-probabilities), and other small-scale experiments [(Reinstein and Bergh, 2020)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1948550619893968?casa\_token=LHG5-s5teJYAAAAA%3AFpnPvCaoS94ADEvRt772GtOEHyhfSWAbWoboSArW\_WZ13s2AACbD6Ty\_Z07M6UhPqC\_ROWKYV1A).

(Other, less EA-relevant results that 'suggested donation amounts' have an impact on donations, which cluster around these amounts. As in previous work, larger suggested donations lead to lower incidence but higher donations conditional on incidence, with ambiguous and contextual net effects.)

_Next steps_: Working with coauthors to write these results up specifically, and [in synthesis (meta-analysis) with the previous evidence](https://daaronr.github.io/dualprocess/index.html#raises-questions). We will 'bound the effect of cost-per-impact information' on donation incidence and average amount, and consider how it informs effective charities and fundraisers.

_Updates:_

* Additional evidence to incorporate from Karlan/Kassirer very large-scale field experiment in a video-gaming context
* Planning followup (April) experiment with ICRC, which may explore different ways of framing the quantitative impact information

### 3. [Facebook fundraising trial](reinstein-longview-psychology-of-effective-giving-project.md#4.-facebook-fundraising-trial-with-paul-smeets-dean-karlan-and-janek-kretschmer) (with Paul Smeets, Dean Karlan, Janek Kretschmer, and Utsav Manjeer)

**Trial incentivizing FB users to start birthday fundraisers for effective charities,** investigating how this behavior (and amounts raised) **responds to effectiveness and rating information** and presentation. Dean Karlan has allocated\* 100k USD funding for supporting donation incentives and tech support for this.

<details>

<summary>*Update on funding, opportunity for more funding</summary>

Dean's funding for donation incentives has some limitations and strings attached. We see some need for more funding to preserve the direct relevance of this to some EA audiences, and to make the experiment more powerful. Funders willing to pay to have us 'donate the first $10' on a fundraising page for an effective charity could be very helpful. (And this seems like a great opportunity to multiply impact, as the average FB birthday fundraiser raises \~$200)

</details>

Design outlined [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T58FKoFnhP7yGhRPXeq3l\_DcvtQ0qcIvwezNWGr5\_ZA/edit#heading=h.909s4uqx06on).

<details>

<summary><em>Update 16 Mar 2022:</em> </summary>



_We have run a very small pilot of the advertising campaign. We have a decent click-through rate but in 240 or so clicks, no one started a fundraising page. This is smaller than our planned pilot and not out of line with Facebook's general reports. Nonetheless, we are re-tooling the page/design, addressing comments on the page from co-authors and peers, and plan to re-launch soon._

* Tech issues: Fundraiser API access or FB engineering may be necessary for the more ambitious design and for efficiently implementing the rewards. We now have a partner co-author within Facebook and are pursuing API access
* Building work
  * Hired Peter Roensby (EA aligned developer), finished building the
  * build of web interface for trial encouraging birthday fundraisers -- see [momentumbirthdayfundraisers.com](https://momentumbirthdayfundraisers.com); refresh to (randomly) generate new treatments pairings randomly on refresh,
  * bot to collect data on fundraisers.

### 3. Just Giving 'seed pages' trial:

<details>

<summary>Just Giving 'seed pages' trial:</summary>

**Purpose**: Investigate 'impact of early contributions (and messages)' to inform 'whether EAs should donate on social media'.

_This text updated_ 9 Feb 2022

\[Placeholder link: [social-influence-justgiving.md](../contexts-and-environments-for-testing/charities-fundraisers-and-impact-information/social-influence-justgiving.md "mention")]

* Scoped out feasible design and power calculations for small-stakes pilot and later 'effectiveness trial'; sufficient pages exist.
  * Conversations and advising from Dillon Bowen on adaptive design, reinforcement and Bayesian learning extensions
* Worked with Oska Fentem (Bristol MRes) and Toby Jolly (UK Cabinet), built API tool to pull down relevant lists of ongoing fundraisers
* Built 'donation-seeding bot' with Peter Roensby -- tested to work, needs stress-testing and integration with API tool. Gained (Linode) server access to maintain this.
* Aim to run self-funded pilot for early to mid 2022 (delayed); possible larger run in 2022-23 giving season

_Next steps:_ Tech steps given in project board [here](https://github.com/daaronr/sponsorship\_design\_analysis/projects/1), mainly linking API and donation seeding bot. Tech is mostly complete, but needs pre-testing and some further power calculations. Reprise outline, pre-registration, power analysis. Run PoC (but also informative) pilots (first 'small seeds' for mainstream charities, then 'large and small seeds' for effective charities)

</details>

### 4. Barriers synthesis

[Web-resource (bookdown): Increasing effective charitable giving: The puzzle, what we know, what we need to know next](https://daaronr.github.io/ea\_giving\_barriers/index.html)

* Updates and additions, some reorganization.
* particularly incorporating recent syntheses (Caviola et al "The many obstacles to effective giving", Noetel et al "What Works..."; [Jaeger and Vugt "Psychological Barriers..." ](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352250X21001779))
  * In light of these papers, renewed focus on '_careful_ evidence-base _on key operationalized claims_' over broad 'literature review'

_Updates_ Feb 2022: New researcher on board -- Annabel Rayner has a Health Economics and meta-analysis background, aims to put 10-15 hours/week into this project.

### 5. Other

Additional content in EA Survey donation report [informs 'do GWWC people fulfill pledges?](https://rethinkpriorities.github.io/ea\_data\_public/eas\_donations.html#plan-actual)'. This work straddles my RP and grant work; I included some additional content and analysis over and above my RP mandate on this.

Offering advice on how to measure impact to a range of organizations, including [80000-hours](../contexts-and-environments-for-testing/80000-hours/ "mention") the University of Chicago EA group, and [charity-elections](../contexts-and-environments-for-testing/charity-elections/ "mention"), which aims to scale up to a large number of high schools, and whom we hope to onboard to the team soon.
