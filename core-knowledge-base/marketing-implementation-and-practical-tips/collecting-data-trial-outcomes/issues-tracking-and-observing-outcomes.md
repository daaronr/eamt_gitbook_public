  For a trial to yield insight, we need to be able to track and measure
  meaningful outcomes, and connect these to the particular 'arm' of the trial
  the person saw ... or whether they saw any arm at all

# Issues: tracking and observing outcomes

1. Tracking: See a page, track action afterwards
2. Putting ads on Youtube and testing click through
3. [Geographic segmentation](../../research-design-and-methodology/experimental-design-methods-issues/splits-randomization-in-practice/geographic-segmentation-blocked-randomization.md): Targeting zip codes and looking at activity from zip codesâ€¦

Other approaches include time-series and difference in difference in response to switching on or off the ad, trial, or page content
