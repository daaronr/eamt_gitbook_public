# ... Pivot tables

### **Pivot tables**

You may want to see or export crosstabs of one outcome, user feature, or design feature, by another.  Sometimes you just want to see these quickly, but this might also be a way to extract the 'raw data' you wish to analyze elsewhere.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
I will investigate further whether this offers any additional information to the data pulled down in the previous section, or whether it's just a shortcut/extract.
{% endhint %}

1. **Select (from any tab and with any filter), select 'Reports', 'Create custom report':**\
   ****\
   ****![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png>)

**2. As above, make sure you've selected the right date range, and (redo) any relevant filters:**

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (19).png>)



**3. "Customize pivot table" – "Breakdowns" ...** the things you want this to disaggregate across (sums and averages within groups)

* the 'campaigns', the 'ad names'
* timing, demographics

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (21).png>)

* Drill down to "Custom breakdowns", "Dynamic Creative Asset", to get it broken down by the text linked to the ads:\

**4. "Customize pivot table" – "Metrics" –**&#x20;

Select the things you want reported, and deselect things that are not interesting or irrelevant to this case (like 'website purchases')

Normally, I'd suggest leaving out the redundant 'Cost per Result' but it's probably good to have as at least one sanity and data check.

Other stuff like 'video play time' could sometimes be very relevant, but I'll leave it out for now

I added a few features I thought might be interesting or useful. Was anyone drawn in to pledge? When did each campaign start/end (doublecheck)? How many _unique_ link clicks?\

**5. (Optional) Conditional formatting**

This could also be helpful if you are using the Ads Manager tools in situ, but obviously this has no value for downloading\

**6.  Save report for later use, share**

Save, save as...\
![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (17).png>)

If you think the report is useful in-situ, you can share a link

**7. Export the data**

As in [#extracting-simple-results](../facebook-meta-ads-interface.md#extracting-simple-results "mention")...
