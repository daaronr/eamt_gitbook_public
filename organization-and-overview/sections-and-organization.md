# Sections and organization

**Overview of grouped sections ... the basic idea:**

1. [Preamble](../)
2. Explain [organization](sections-and-organization.md) of the [team](our-team-and-resources/) and [our tools ](https://github.com/daaronr/effective\_giving\_market\_testing/tree/76fd750340efe8794ed505cc87e8e0905ddeb98e/organization-and-overview/how-this-gitbook-works/README.md)
3. "Background:
   * [What we're trying to do and why](../background/the-challenge-how-little-we-know-about-drivers-of-effective-ineffective-giving.md),
   * [What is known/models of effective giving](../background/models-theories-psychological-norms.md),&#x20;
   * P[rinciples and theories behind potential trials](../background/tools-interventions-principles.md)
4. [Tools and trials](../proposed-tools-for-motivating-effective-giving/tools-and-trials-overview.md): specific things we want to do/test; (partly) grouped by 'outcomes' (esp. [effectiveness](../proposed-tools-for-motivating-effective-giving/oc-effective-donation-consider-effectiveness/) & [commitment](../proposed-tools-for-motivating-effective-giving/moral-duty-of-well-off/)) (_Consider merging this with next/previous section)_
5. Contexts/environments, specific plans for trials in these contexts (template for reporting, cross-organizations, by organization)
6.  [Methods](broken-reference): discuss issues of methodology & '[how to implement](https://github.com/daaronr/effective\_giving\_market\_testing/tree/76fd750340efe8794ed505cc87e8e0905ddeb98e/contexts-and-environments-for-testing/implementation-and-collecting-data-issues/README.md) tricky things right'&#x20;

    (Let's link this in other sections not rehash each debate)

    * [Qualitative design issues](../methodological-discussion/qualitative-design-issues.md)
    * [Quant issues](../methodological-discussion/experimental-design-methods-issues.md)
    * [Implementation issues](../methodological-discussion/implementation-and-collecting-data-issues/), 'practical' issues
7. [Project: Profiling 'whom to target' ](../profiling-and-segmentation/profiling-discussion.md)
8.  [Supplements and references](broken-reference): Useful discussions and spinoff conversations I didn't know where else to put
