# Sections and organization

**Overview of grouped sections ... the basic idea:**

1. [Preamble](../)
2. Explain [organization](sections-and-organization.md) of the [team](our-team-and-resources.md) and [our tools ](how-this-gitbook-works/)
3. "Background:
   * [What we're trying to do and why](../background-and-existing-evidence/the-challenge-how-little-we-know-about-drivers-of-effective-ineffective-giving.md),
   * [What is known/models of effective giving](../background-and-existing-evidence/models-theories-psychological-norms.md), 
   * P[rinciples behind potential trials](../background-and-existing-evidence/tools-interventions-principles.md)
4. [Tools and trials](../proposed-tools-for-motivating-effective-giving/tools-and-trials-overview.md): specific things we want to do/test; \(partly\) grouped by 'outcomes' \(esp. [effectiveness](../proposed-tools-for-motivating-effective-giving/oc-effective-donation-consider-effectiveness/) & [commitment](../proposed-tools-for-motivating-effective-giving/moral-duty-of-well-off/)\)
5. Contexts/environments, specific plans for trials in these contexts
6. Methods: discuss issues of methodology & '[how to implement](../contexts-and-environments-for-testing/implementation-and-collecting-data-issues/) tricky things right' 
   * Let's link this in other sections not rehash each debate
7. [Project: Profiling 'whom to target' ](../profiling-and-segmentation/profiling-discussion.md)
   * \(sufficiently distinct from the above so it gets its own section\)
