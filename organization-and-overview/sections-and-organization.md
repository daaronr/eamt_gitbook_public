# Sections and organization

**Overview of grouped sections ... the basic idea:**

1. [Preamble](../)
2. Explain [organization](sections-and-organization.md) of the [team](our-team-and-resources/) and [our tools](https://github.com/daaronr/effective\_giving\_market\_testing/tree/76fd750340efe8794ed505cc87e8e0905ddeb98e/organization-and-overview/how-this-gitbook-works/README.md)
3. "Background:
   * [What we're trying to do and why](broken-reference/),
   * [What is known/models of effective giving](../background-and-existing-evidence/models-theories-psychological-norms.md),
   * P[rinciples and theories behind potential trials](../background-and-existing-evidence/tools-interventions-principles.md)
4. [Tools and trials](../proposed-tools-for-motivating-effective-giving/tools-and-trials-overview/): specific things we want to do/test; (partly) grouped by 'outcomes' (esp. [effectiveness](../proposed-tools-for-motivating-effective-giving/oc-effective-donation-consider-effectiveness/) & [commitment](../proposed-tools-for-motivating-effective-giving/oc-effective-donation-consider-effectiveness/moral-duty-of-well-off/))
5. Contexts/environments, specific plans for trials in these contexts
   1. Cross-organization plans
   2. By each organization
      1. Background on the organization and the environments within
      2. Plans and progress on trials within each
   3. T[emplate for reporting](../contexts-and-environments-for-testing/trial-reporting-template.md#concise-reporting-template) trials and progress
6.  [Methods](broken-reference/): discuss issues of methodology & '[how to implement](https://github.com/daaronr/effective\_giving\_market\_testing/tree/76fd750340efe8794ed505cc87e8e0905ddeb98e/contexts-and-environments-for-testing/implementation-and-collecting-data-issues/README.md) tricky things right'

    _(Let's link to this in other sections not rehash each debate in multiple places)_

    * \_\_[Qualitative design issues](../methodological-discussion/qualitative-design-issues.md)
    * [Quantitative design and method issues](../methodological-discussion/experimental-design-methods-issues.md)
    * [Implementation issues](../methodological-discussion/implementation-and-collecting-data-issues/), 'practical' issues
7. [Project: Profiling 'whom to target'](../profiling-and-segmentation/profiling-discussion.md)
8. [Supplements and references](broken-reference/): Useful discussions and spinoff conversations I didn't know where else to put
