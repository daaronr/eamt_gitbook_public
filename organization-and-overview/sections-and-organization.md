# Sections and organization

**Overview of grouped sections ... the basic idea:**

1. Preamble
2. Explain organization of the team and our tools 
3. "Background": What are we trying to do and why, is known, how to organize and think about the things we want to test and why they might work
4. Tools and trials: specific things we want to do and test;  \(Partially\) grouped by 'outcome of interest'
5. Contexts/environments, specific plans for trials in these contexts ... making it happen
6. Methods: discuss issues of methodology and 'how to implement tricky things right' \(to link in other sections\)
7. Project: Profiling 'whom to target' \(sufficiently distinct from the above so it gets its own section
