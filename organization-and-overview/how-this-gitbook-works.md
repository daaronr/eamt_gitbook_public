# How this 'gitbook' works

## What is this Gitbook \(wiki\) and what is it for?

## Who has access/how to gain access?

{% hint style="info" %}
As of 21 July 2021 this is public, but we will make it a private book. As we are conducting trials, we cannot have this accessible to the whole world, including participants. However, we hope to make most of this public in due time, in line with information sharing and open science.
{% endhint %}

## What do the sections and groups mean?

## How do I edit it and add content?

{% hint style="info" %}
In newly created blocks/elements "command-slash" \(on mac\) brings up a lot of cool options
{% endhint %}

## What are 'saving' and 'merging'?

## Technical: Connections with Git/Github and coding

This Gitbook is connected to the private github-hosted repo [https://github.com/daaronr/effective\_giving\_market\_testing](https://github.com/daaronr/effective_giving_market_testing).   
It 'backs up' nicely to a set of easy-to-follow markdown files and folders. If you prefer not to use the web interface, you should be able to edit those files in any interface and push/merge the content in. I tested this on 22 July -- it seems to work nicely.

$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Once you're strong enough, save the world:
{% endhint %}

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}
