# How this 'gitbook' works

## What is this Gitbook \(wiki\) and what is it for?

Rather than chains of disconnected emails and many unlinked Google docs, I \(David Reinstein\) thought it would be better to organize our project with this well-structured format.

## Who has access/how to gain access?

{% hint style="info" %}
As of 22 July 2021 this is a PRIVATE site, only accessible to members. As we are conducting trials, we cannot have this accessible to the whole world, including participants. However, we hope to make most of this public in due time, in line with information sharing and open science.
{% endhint %}

## What do the sections and groups mean?

## How do I edit it and add content?

{% hint style="info" %}
In newly created blocks/elements "command-slash" \(on mac\) brings up a lot of cool options
{% endhint %}

## What are 'saving' and 'merging'?

You need to click 'save' to save your work \(hopefully with a quick message explaining what you did\). You then need to 'merge it in' to be part of the shared repository. \(This has some connection to underlying git processes.\)

**What if I get a 'conflict'?** If 2 people edit simultaneously and both make changes they try to merge in, this can happen. It should be simple enough to resolve. Just find the icon for the bits indicating a conflict, and choose which version you want to keep.

## Technical: Connections with Git/Github and coding

This Gitbook is connected to the private github-hosted repo \[daaronr/effective\_giving\_market\_testing\]\([https://github.com/daaronr/effective\_giving\_market\_testing](https://github.com/daaronr/effective_giving_market_testing)\]. It 'backs up' nicely to a set of easy-to-follow markdown files and folders. If you prefer not to use the web interface, you should be able to edit those files in any interface and push/merge the content in.

I tested this on 22 July -- it seems to work very nicely, but it seems to want to set up another 'main/master' branch and then you have to merge it in
