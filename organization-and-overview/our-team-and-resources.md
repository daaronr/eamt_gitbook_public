# Our team and resources

We are a group of academic and practical research practitioners across a range of fields \(Economics, Psychology, Marketing, Statistics\) and organizations, particularly those interested in effective charitable giving and effective altruism. This is outlined in the [Airtable](https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=invrYLQD6MCwj5tzF&inviteToken=756e551c2eb2be11add77811fa080f3ac80c5adc68b402c5dcbbc4a16684b836&utm_source=email) [\(invite link\)](https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=invrYLQD6MCwj5tzF&inviteToken=756e551c2eb2be11add77811fa080f3ac80c5adc68b402c5dcbbc4a16684b836&utm_source=email), with embedded views below.

As individuals and organizations are goal-driven and impact driven: we are in this to improve the world, particular through directing funds and support to the most effective causes and interventions. Because we share these common goals, we are better aligned for collaboration than typical academics and charitable organizations.
