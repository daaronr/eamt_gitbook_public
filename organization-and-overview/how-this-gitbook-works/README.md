# How this 'gitbook' works: Moved to Public Gitbook to avoid duplication

See [Public gitbook here](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-MfFk4CTSGwVOPkwnRgx/s/a3YtWoUiYYfiEQrBNztC/organization-and-overview/how-this-gitbook-works)


## What is this Gitbook (wiki) and what is it for?

_Rather than chains of disconnected emails and many unlinked Google docs, I (David Reinstein) thought it would be better to organize our project with this well-structured format._

## Who has access/how to gain access?

{% hint style="info" %}
This is a PRIVATE site, only accessible to members. As we are conducting trials, we cannot have this accessible to the whole world, including participants. However, we hope to make most of this public in due time, in line with information sharing and open science.
