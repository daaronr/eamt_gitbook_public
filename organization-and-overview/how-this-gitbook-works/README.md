# How this 'gitbook' works

## What is this Gitbook (wiki) and what is it for?

_Rather than chains of disconnected emails and many unlinked Google docs, I (David Reinstein) thought it would be better to organize our project with this well-structured format._

## Who has access/how to gain access?

{% hint style="info" %}
This is a PRIVATE site, only accessible to members. As we are conducting trials, we cannot have this accessible to the whole world, including participants. However, we hope to make most of this public in due time, in line with information sharing and open science.
{% endhint %}

## What do the sections and groups mean?

"Groups" can hold multiple pages and pages can have sub-pages. But groups cannot have subgroups and the groups have no direct link (while pages do). (In the 'git repo' groups seem to be represented by folders).

## How do I edit it and add content?

#### Getting started

If you have 'write (Editor) access' ....

_**Update**_: as of 15 Oct 2021 Gitbook has changed their protocols. You now need to

* click the icon in the upper right to 'start a change request',
* and then 'submit' this request when you are ready (ideally, with a brief informative message explaining what you have done.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1).png>)

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (1) (1).png>)

Give it a try. Once you 'submit', you, or someone else can 'merge' it in.

{% hint style="info" %}
In newly created blocks/elements "command-slash" (on mac) brings up a lot of cool options (scroll down)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Typing the "@" symbol offers a quick way to link other pages in this book
{% endhint %}

## Merges and conflicts

If you have the Administrator status, you can merge in your own, or others' changes.

**What if I get a 'conflict'?** If 2 people edit simultaneously and both make changes they try to merge in, this can happen. It should be simple enough to resolve. Just find the icon for the bits indicating a conflict, and choose which version you want to keep.

It should be simple enough to resolve.

Just find the icon for the bits indicating a conflict in the outline bar (that arrow triangle thing), go to that section/those sections, and choose which version you want to keep.

## Technical: Connections with Git/Github and coding

This Gitbook is connected to the private [github-hosted repo here](https://github.com/daaronr/effective\_giving\_market\_testing):

```bash
https://github.com/daaronr/effective_giving_market_testing
```

It 'backs up' nicely to a set of easy-to-follow markdown files and folders. If you prefer to work offline, in nice 'raw text formats' (rather than via the web interface)... you should be able to edit those files in any interface and push/merge the content in. (If you are familiar with git and Github.
