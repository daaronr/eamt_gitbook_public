# Sharing outside the group?

## Discussion and consensus

We discussed 'what can be shared outside the group' at [#planned-meeting-s-for-early-january](../../tip-o-the-spear.md#planned-meeting-s-for-early-january "mention") See google [discussion  doc here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WCvQq7HEHDzJ\_DcvejzM9Y67hFr9UHYaBXVY260Dlj4/edit).

> GWWC/Luke:   GWWC: Basically OK to share, with some sensitivities. Luke: generally happy to share things. Data: only personal data is sensitive, and we rarely come across it; also consider ‘optics issues’; we want to be careful about that. Avoid discussing cost and spends on ads.



## The 'public version' of this resource

The proposed 'public' versino of this gitbook, redacted, semi-automating integration
{% endembed %}

DR I was thinking we may want a version of our gitbook we can share publicly. Many of the tools we are building are not confidential (e.g., the methodology, the background, the tips on making ads). We may want to share these in the EA community and with academic and other partners, or even on the WWW, without having to share ’all the details of our ongoing trials.\\

To this end … see [HERE](https://effective-giving-marketing.gitbook.io/untitled/lZF4xKeC9iVglophCgV8/). This is another space in the "Gitbook team" (a ‘branch’ if you use the GH integration, soon to be a public ‘fork’ if we agree). I’ve created this version\\

* _redacting and removing_ anything that (seemed to me) might be private or something we wouldn’t want to share (all details of trials, organizational priorities, and things that seemed like private conversation, e.g., the ‘potential academic papers’ Gdoc)
* I’m building this so that ‘new content in non-private sections’ should be easy to update into this version … _so no need for anyone on our team to WORK in this version, please continue to work in the private version_

From RP slack (reporting on public studies ... but I'll remove specific commentary, and redact mention of "Jamie's work")
