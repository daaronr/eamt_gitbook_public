# Tools/interventions: principles

## EA Barriers Synthesis discussion, tool categories

I very briefly discuss particular tools in the Bookdown:

A more organized categorization of barriers can be found in an airtable database \(view below\), linked to tables of specific tools, theories, barriers, etc. \(This can be accessed [HERE](https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=inv6xUeeKxDNpmKrF&inviteToken=86038068d336c4e9673866b43a0e32cd7edcbfe253bc346408e01c5e425f5f5b&utm_source=email); it is _not_ the airtable for this project, although we link in some content\).

## Specific tools

The above table links a set of specific tools, evaluating their relevance for effective giving:

We are considering a narrower set of tools \(in a different airtable, the airtable for the current project...  

#### Specific proposed tools/interventions \(GWWC focus, adding WIP\)
