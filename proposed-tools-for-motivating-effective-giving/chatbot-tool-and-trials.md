## Misc discussion on chatbots

> JL: chatbots might also be interesting as a foot in the door to getting someone to speak with a human. like a FB ad to speak with a chatbot that has an option to call a human might do better than a FB ad to call with a human
>
> DR: I like it, especially if it is not presented as ‘pawning people off on a chatbot’ or tricking them into thinking its a human
