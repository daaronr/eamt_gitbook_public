# Presenting impact efficiency information


Potential Donorsâ€™ reaction to presentation of impact information in various forms

## Reinstein's work


[Impact of impact treatments on giving: field experiments and synthesis](https://daaronr.github.io/dualprocess/index.html) (much of my work is there, but not ongoing experiments. See also ["Barriers to effective giving" -- evidence synthesis](https://daaronr.github.io/ea_giving_barriers/index.html), especially

- [Barriers: Aversion/obstacles to doing (using) evaluations; effect of analytical information on generosity](https://daaronr.github.io/ea_giving_barriers/eval-aversion.html)

- I'm preparing and running (have run) several field experiments that test different presentations of impact information in large-scale settings. We can discuss.
    - Donor's Voice/CRS (not particular accurate impact info)
    - A Swiss-based charity mailing
    - FB fundraisers promo (working on)
    - Social fundraisers, possible 'seeding info' about effectiveness, possible collaboration opportunitys
- There is always room for more work on this, the space is vast!



# Lewis:

Donors tend to target the cost in impact information e.g., they are more likely to donate at least \$20 if they find out that a meal costs \$20, more likely to donate at least \$30 if a meal costs \$30... but that does not necessarily mean they donate more on average when the cost is higher. In my field experiment with ARC, people donate less when the cost is higher, as more people donate zero when they learn they can provide, say, two days of shelter for \$100 than one day of shelter for \$50. Lots more context to this of course.
