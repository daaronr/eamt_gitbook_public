# Giving guides - Facebook

<summary>Notes on content/building this</summary>

This follows the [trial-reporting-template.md](../../marketing-and-testing-opportunities-tools-tips/trial-reporting-template.md "mention"), edited slightly for public reading.

We are building the results and analysis in a  transparent way; directly importing the data and doing our own analyses ... within the [EAMT Analysis web-book here.](https://daaronr.github.io/eamt\_data\_analysis/chapters/gwwc\_gg.html)

## Summary

**Context**: Facebook ads on a range of audiences.

**Objective**: Test distinct approaches to messaging, aiming to get people to download our Giving Guide. (Previously called "emotional and factual" approaches; basically these were "Charity research facts" vs. "cause focus")

Worked with a creative agency to develop a set of animated video ads: Differing texts

Also informative about costs and the 'value of targeting' in this context

Note this had several 'versions' during the campaign (see 'Test 1 - Test 4')



**Key findings:**

* The cost of an email address via a Facebook campaign during Giving Season was as low as $8.00 across campaigns but could be lower with more targeting.
* “Only 3% of people give effectively,” seems to be an effective message for generating link clicks and email addresses vs. the other messages.
* Lookalike and animal rights audiences seem the most promising audiences.
* Demographics are not very predictive on a per-$ basis.



**Key caveats**

* **Specificity and interpretation:** All comparisons are not for 'audiences of similar composition' but for 'the best audience Facebook could find to show the ads, within each group, according to its algorithm'.  Thus differences in performance may combine 'better targeting' with 'better performance on the targeted group'. See our [detailed discussion HERE](https://effective-giving-marketing.gitbook.io/untitled/methodological-discussion/splits-randomization/facebook-split-testing-etc).
  * I.e., we can make statements about "what works better on Facebook in this context and maybe similar contexts"&#x20;
  * but not about "which audience, as defined, is more receptive" (as the targeting _within_ each audience may differ in unobserved ways),
  * nor about "which message works better on a particular comparable audience" (for the same reason)
* **Outcome** is 'click to download the giving guide'. This&#x20;
