# EA Market Testing Introduction

## What is the "EA Market Testing Team"?

We are a small group of researchers and practitioners. Our goal is to promote effective altruism and effective charitable giving through marketing campaigns, appeals, and events, both with our [partner organizations](broken-reference) and in independent surveys and trials. We want to improve the design and messaging of organizations like [Giving What We Can](contexts-partner-organizations-trials/gwwc/) and 80000 Hours to maximize their outreach and eventual impact.\
\
While _doing_ marketing we are also _testing and analyzing_ this rigorously. We run carefully controlled trials and robustly analyze the results. However, we are careful to be _efficient_, recognizing the tradeoffs between rigorous experimental design and practical marketing.  \
\
We track, organize, and share what we have learned with the EA community, building and organizing resources and a knowledge base.  This will address questions such as:&#x20;

* How to [implement](marketing-and-testing-opportunities-tools-tips/implementation-and-collecting-data-issues/) and test marketing campaigns?
* [What has worked](https://daaronr.github.io/eamt\_data\_analysis/) to promote EA?
* What [motivates/blocks effective giving](https://daaronr.github.io/ea\_giving\_barriers/)?&#x20;
* What [profiles of people are](broken-reference) most likely to be interested in effective altruism? &#x20;

We strive to be transparent. We want to report and share our data, procedures, code, and evidence without overselling the results.\


## What is our mission?

### We believe this is the first organized collaboration of its kind. We aim to:

* Coalesce our understanding and evidence on barriers and facilitators of effective altruism, effective giving, and effective action
* Run a broad set of high-powered trials (large samples, high-stake real-world contexts, substantial differences between conditions)&#x20;
  * ... to gather evidence on _what works best_ to promote meaningful actions in _specific_ cases...
  * ... while aiming at _generalizable_ principles and approaches (see  '[high-value questions'](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jyn\_6aFt7z1kDo-6sHm9o\_ccPgEvig1b6c8OqPRH2eI/edit#heading=h.gjcw9rquq2um))
* Do [profiling](broken-reference/),[ survey, and segmentation](broken-reference/) activities and trials, building evidence on 'which types of people' are most responsive to effective giving messages and appeals
* Share our results, data, and tools, (and [testing templates](marketing-and-testing-opportunities-tools-tips/trial-reporting-template.md), guides and [implementation tips](marketing-and-testing-opportunities-tools-tips/implementation-and-collecting-data-issues/)) with the relevant EA and research-interested communitoes. This will enable more and better outreach, promotion, testing, and insight.

Note that we cannot publicly share details of _ongoing, upcoming, and continuing_ trials, but we aim to share the results when it is possible. (To do: integrate shareable aspects of [this private doc.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w9kUiJguWZx4EIvGBd7l0qMTJHWdlHV5z-pvKcdNPOA/edit))

## **"Testimonials" (putting this together)**

***

**Luke Freeman, Executive Director of Giving What We Can:**

> “The EA Market Testing team has been very helpful in helping us to pursue our mission of creating a world where giving effectively and significantly is a cultural norm. They have helped us at each stage along the process of ideation through to analysis so that we can base our outreach activities on sound theory and strong evidence. This is at a particularly important time as we have been scaling up our marketing activities to reach and engage new audiences with effective giving and the ideas of effective altruism more broadly. We look forward to an ongoing collaboration with EAMT so that we can continue to iterate and increase our impact.”

***

**Grace Adams, Head of Marketing, Giving What We Can:**

> It’s been extremely useful to hear what others in EA, individuals and orgs are doing and sharing learnings between us. I hope that we can develop a set of tactics that we know successfully convert people and get them more involved in EA. A reliable set of best practices for marketing EA would be a great outcome.



#### Greg Gianopoulis, Charity Elections

> As a quick testimonial relevant to this stage of the process, David \[Reinstein]'s support has been critical to the Charity Elections team's development of plans for marketing and program evaluation. Our first ad campaign was particularly impactful, generating one click to the [Charity Elections page](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/events/guides/charity-elections) on the Giving What We Can website per $0.01 spent on the campaign. We will continue to incorporate his advice into our advertising to spread awareness of the Charity Elections program among high school students and teachers.
