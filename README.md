## What is the "EA Market Testing Team"?

The “EA Market Testing Team” represents a small group of researchers and practitioners interested in promoting effective altruism and effective charitable giving and learning more about what motivates this.

## What is our mission?

### To the best of our knowledge, this is the first organized collaboration of its kind. We aim to:

* Coalesce our understanding and evidence on barriers and facilitators of effective altruism/effective giving/effective action
* Run a broad set of powerful trials and experiments. gathering evidence on _what works best_ to promote meaningful actions in specific cases. We aim at generalizable principles and approaches. See our discussion of '[high-value questions'](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jyn\_6aFt7z1kDo-6sHm9o\_ccPgEvig1b6c8OqPRH2eI/edit#heading=h.gjcw9rquq2um)
* Do [profiling](broken-reference/),[ survey, and segmentation](broken-reference/) activities and trials, building evidence on which types of people are most responsive to effective giving messages and appeals
* Share our results, data, and tools with the larger community interested in effective giving; report our work both for practitioners and researchers/academics.
* Enable more outreach and promotion, as well as more testing, by offering templates and [implementation tips](marketing-and-testing-opportunities-tools-tips/implementation-and-collecting-data-issues/)

## **"Testimonials" (putting this together)**

***

**Luke Freeman, Executive Director of Giving What We Can:**

> “The EA Market Testing team has been very helpful in helping us to pursue our mission of creating a world where giving effectively and significantly is a cultural norm. They have helped us at each stage along the process of ideation through to analysis so that we can base our outreach activities on sound theory and strong evidence. This is at a particularly important time as we have been scaling up our marketing activities to reach and engage new audiences with effective giving and the ideas of effective altruism more broadly. We look forward to an ongoing collaboration with EAMT so that we can continue to iterate and increase our impact.”

***

**Grace Adams, Head of Marketing, Giving What We Can:**

> It’s been extremely useful to hear what others in EA, individuals and orgs are doing and sharing learnings between us. I hope that we can develop a set of tactics that we know successfully convert people and get them more involved in EA. A reliable set of best practices for marketing EA would be a great outcome.



#### Greg Gianopoulis, Charity Elections

> As a quick testimonial relevant to this stage of the process, David \[Reinstein]'s support has been critical to the Charity Elections team's development of plans for marketing and program evaluation. Our first ad campaign was particularly impactful, generating one click to the [Charity Elections page](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/events/guides/charity-elections) on the Giving What We Can website per $0.01 spent on the campaign. We will continue to incorporate his advice into our advertising to spread awareness of the Charity Elections program among high school students and teachers.
