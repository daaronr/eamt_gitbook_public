# Effective Giving and Action: Market testing and Synthesis

{% hint style="warning" %}
We are in the process of restructuring the gitbook! You may see some sections and pages that are incomplete, but they will be updated soon.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Welcome to our shared workspace and knowledge base!&#x20;

### What is the purpose of this gitbook?&#x20;

This gitbook is an <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**internal**</mark> resource for our project. It is a shared and centralized working space for the team to:

1. Create, share, and update project plans in one place
2. Discuss projects and make decisions
3. Report findings from studies
4. Curate our resources and build a knowledge-base

{% hint style="success" %}
We encourage _**you**_ (yes you!) to use this space to collaborate and share your knowledge by editing pages and adding comments. If you are unfamiliar with gitbook, you will get the hang of it! Think about using it similarly to Google docs.&#x20;

Learn how to use the tool [here](processes-and-procedures/teach-me-to-use-our-tools/), read[ GitBook's guide](https://docs.gitbook.com/editing-content/editing-pages), or ask us for help getting started.
{% endhint %}

### How is this different from the public gitbook?

While the internal gitbook is a space to document how we are planning and executing projects, the three key aims of the [public gitbook](https://effective-giving-marketing.gitbook.io/untitled/) are to:&#x20;

1. **Convey** **who we are, what have accomplished, and the scope of our work** to funders, people in the broader EA community, and people not yet involved in the project who would be interested in joining
2. **Share tools and knowledge with** **people who will apply it to their work.** Content in the public gitbook can inform and support a diverse set of projects (i.e., implementing marketing campaigns, fundraising initiatives, academic research)&#x20;
3. **Seek feedback on our work**. This includes technical and industry feedback on implementation and academic expertise (literature reviews and frameworks to consider, methodology, and experimental design).

{% hint style="warning" %}
**All confidential or private details** will be removed before adding content to the public version (i.e., cost and ad spend, personal data)

**Information about future or ongoing trials should only be in the internal version** until the report is finalized and approved for sharing by the point of contact for the project.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Some sections will be duplicated in the public and internal gitbooks. However, most content will be in **one** of the two versions and linked in the other.
{% endhint %}

## Project description & mission

#### The “EA Market Testing Team” is a group of researchers and practitioners interested in

* promoting effective charitable giving,
* building awareness and understanding of ideas associated with effective altruism,
* fostering involvement in the EA movement and associated groups,
* and learning more about what motivates this.

#### To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such organized collaboration of its kind. We aim to:

* Coalesce our understanding and evidence on barriers and facilitators of effective altruism/effective giving/effective action
* Run a broad set of powerful trials and experiments (esp. in large-scale settings), gathering evidence on ‘what works best' to promote meaningful actions (donations and commitments) in specific cases, as well as evdc on general principles and approaches
* Conduct [profiling, survey, and segmentation activities and trials](profiling-and-segmentation/profiling-discussion.md), building evidence on which 'types of people' are most responsive to effective giving messages and appeals
* Share our results, data, and tools with the larger community interested in effective giving; report our work both for practitioners and researchers/academics
