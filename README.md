# Effective Giving & Action: Market testing & Synthesis (public version)

{% hint style="warning" %}
We are in the process of restructuring the gitbook! You may see some sections and pages that are incomplete, but they will be updated soon.&#x20;

## What is the "EA Market Testing Team"?

The “EA Market Testing Team” represents a small group of researchers and practitioners interested in promoting effective altruism and effective charitable giving and learning more about what motivates this.&#x20;

## What is our mission?

### To the best of our knowledge, this is the first organized collaboration of its kind. We aim to:

* Coalesce our understanding and evidence on barriers and facilitators of effective altruism/effective giving/effective action
* Run a broad set of powerful trials and experiments (esp. in large-scale settings), gathering evidence on ‘what works best to promote meaningful actions (donations and commitments) in specific cases as well as general principles and approaches
* Conduct [profiling, survey, and segmentation activities and trials](broken-reference), building evidence on which types of people are most responsive to effective giving messages and appeals
* Share our results, data, and tools with the larger community interested in effective giving; report our work both for practitioners and researchers/academics
