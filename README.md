## Welcome to our shared workspace and knowledge base!

### What is the “EA Market Testing Team”?

#### The “EA Market Testing Team” is a group of researchers and practitioners interested in

* Promoting effective charitable giving
* Building awareness and understanding of ideas associated with effective altruism
* Fostering involvement in the EA movement and associated groups
* Learning more about what motivates this

### What is our mission?

#### To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such organized collaboration of its kind. We aim to:

* Coalesce our understanding and evidence on barriers and facilitators of effective altruism/effective giving/effective action
* Run a broad set of powerful trials and experiments (esp. in large-scale settings), gathering evidence on ‘what works best' to promote meaningful actions (donations and commitments) in specific cases, as well as evidence on general principles and approaches
* Conduct [profiling, survey, and segmentation activities and trials](profiling-and-segmentation/profiling-discussion.md), building evidence on which 'types of people' are most responsive to effective giving messages and appeals
* Share our results, data, and tools with the larger community interested in effective giving; report our work both for practitioners and researchers/academics
