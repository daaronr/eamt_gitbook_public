# Procedures, FAQs

## Sharing and publishing our results

> Will you keep your work continuously public or plan to publish bite-sized reports? I would be interested to stay updated to learn from your continuously, if possible.

_David Reinstein_: Ideally, both. After we run experiments I would like to make the analysis and data public. (Some analysis we might only want to share within EA fundraising orgs and researchers, for a while, while the broader set of trials are ongoing.)

I envision sharing the results in dynamic public documents like:

* [“Impact of impact treatments on giving: field experiments and synthesis”](https://daaronr.github.io/dualprocess/index.html)
* [Increasing effective charitable giving: The puzzle, what we know, what we need to know next](https://daaronr.github.io/ea\_giving\_barriers/eval-aversion.html)
* Or in somewhat slicker/more GUI-interfaced ‘Gitbooks’ \[like the present one)

Data/code/materials should be stored/shared on OSF and Github.

The above is meant as a continuous research project and updated ‘continuously available’ resource bank _BUT ALSO_ I think we will/should put out ‘bite-sized’ versions and updates, as things come out.

We may also produce and public academic-style work, including in journals. I personally favor [a journal-independent peer review and evaluation approach.](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-MfFk4CTSGwVOPkwnRgx/s/-MkORcaM5xGxmrnczq25/)
