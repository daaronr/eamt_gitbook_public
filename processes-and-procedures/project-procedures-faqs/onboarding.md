### Onboarding meeting checklist&#x20;

* **Overview of our project**&#x20;
  * Who are “we”?&#x20;

  * What work has happened so far?&#x20;
    * Point out five key parts of the public gitbook (Background evidence framework, Contexts - environments - plan tests, Research design and methodologies, Marketing implementation strategies and tips, Profiling and segmentation project)
* **Establish how we will work with their organization**
  * The types of projects we’ve done with organizations previously
  * Document what types of projects they are interested in doing with us
    * Do they have any campaigns coming up that we could do testing on?&#x20;
    * What do they want to learn?&#x20;
    * Add notes from this discussion to their organization gitbook page and ask them to add to their gitbook page
  * Biweekly communication
    * If we aren’t already in communication, I will check in by email or slack biweekly. What channel of communication is better for them?
