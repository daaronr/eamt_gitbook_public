# Sharing outside the group?

## Sharing and publishing our results

> Will you keep your work continuously public or plan to publish bite-sized reports? I would be interested to stay updated to learn from your continuously, if possible.

_David Reinstein_: Ideally, both. After we run experiments I would like to make the analysis and data public. (Some analysis we might only want to share within EA fundraising orgs and researchers, for a while, while the broader set of trials are ongoing.)

I envision sharing the results in dynamic public documents like:

* [“Impact of impact treatments on giving: field experiments and synthesis”](https://daaronr.github.io/dualprocess/index.html)
* [Increasing effective charitable giving: The puzzle, what we know, what we need to know next](https://daaronr.github.io/ea\_giving\_barriers/eval-aversion.html)
* Or in somewhat slicker/more GUI-interfaced ‘Gitbooks’ \[like the present one)

Data/code/materials should be stored/shared on OSF and Github.

The above is meant as a continuous research project and updated ‘continuously available’ resource bank _BUT ALSO_ I think we will/should put out ‘bite-sized’ versions and updates, as things come out.

We may also produce and public academic-style work, including in journals. I personally favor [a journal-independent peer review and evaluation approach.](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-MfFk4CTSGwVOPkwnRgx/s/-MkORcaM5xGxmrnczq25/)

## Discussion and consensus

We discussed 'what can be shared outside the group' at [#planned-meeting-s-for-early-january](../../tip-o-the-spear.md#planned-meeting-s-for-early-january "mention") See [google discussion doc here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WCvQq7HEHDzJ\_DcvejzM9Y67hFr9UHYaBXVY260Dlj4/edit#heading=h.cg90o34wlpye).

#### GWWC/Luke:

Basically OK to share, with some sensitivities. Luke: generally happy to share things. Data: only personal data is sensitive, and we rarely come across it; also consider ‘optics issues’; we want to be careful about that. Avoid discussing cost and spends on ads.

#### OftW Jack Lewars

> Fine for you to share everything in anonymised format David, thanks - as in, as long as all participant data is anonymised. You can say you were working with us.&#x20;

**80k, Bella Forristal:**

&#x20;… right now share approx nothing because everything is ongoing, but once we wrap something up we can share it (and I’ll let you know when that is).**...** when we have details of trials which are no longer ongoing, I’m happy for them to be shared

## The 'public version' of this resource

> DR I was thinking we may want a version of our gitbook we can share publicly. Many of the tools we are building are not confidential (e.g., the methodology, the background, the tips on making ads). We may want to share these in the EA community and with academic and other partners, or even on the WWW, without having to share ’all the details of our ongoing trials.'

To this end … see [HERE](https://effective-giving-marketing.gitbook.io/untitled/lZF4xKeC9iVglophCgV8/). This is another space in the "Gitbook team" (a ‘branch’ if you use the GH integration, soon to be a public ‘fork’ if we agree). I’ve created this version...

* _redacting and removing_ anything that (seemed to me) might be private or something we wouldn’t want to share (all details of trials, organizational priorities, and things that seemed like private conversation, e.g., the ‘potential academic papers’ Gdoc)
* I’m building this so that ‘new content in non-private sections’ should be easy to update into this version … _so no need for anyone on our team to WORK in this version, please continue to work in the private version_
* Update Feb 2022: all content that is _not_ private or sensitive should go _only_ in the public version and simply be linked/bookmarked/embedded here in the private verseion
