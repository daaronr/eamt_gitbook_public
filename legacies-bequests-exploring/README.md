# Legacies/bequests (exploring)

## Key ideas

* "Boomer" wealth will be passed on to heirs soon ... huge amounts
* Bequest fundraising seen to have high-ROI
* Some psych/econ/legal reasons why people might be particular willing to donate from their 'leftover assets at death'
* Some initiatives exist (see below), 'Oftw/Gwwc/TLYCS' might plug in to these
* [Reinstein has some ideas](https://davidreinstein.wordpress.com/2018/07/16/inheritance-tax-and-charitable-bequests-an-intergenerational-pact/?platform=hootsuite) about facilitating negotiations among parents and children (legates and legatees) to help discover a shared interest in effective pledging/giving
* Consider writing up an MVP and doing a trial in Spring 2022?

## Key existing initiatives and tools

### Pledges

("The Giving pledge")

#### ["Generation pledge"](https://www.generationpledge.org)

{% embed url="https://www.generationpledge.org" %}

\> To join Generation Pledge, inheritors must commit to: 1 Donate at least 10% of their inheritance to effective causes within the first 5 years of inheriting 2 Mobilise their financial, social, career, and political capital to generate the greatest impact, before and after inheriting

[@Peter Wildeford](https://rethinkpriorities.slack.com/team/U019CL8FK4H) Yes! Generation Pledge is a community for UHNW individuals who pledge to give at least 10% of their future inheritance. The community incentivizes and advises them on how to have the most impact with both their financial and their social capital (connections, easy access to important people, etc.). They have 70 members (people who took the pledge) from all over the globe, amounting to ca. $1.5B in pledged money. I'd say that max. 10% of their members are EA-aligned right now. \[DR: what about the 'effective' part it?] The pledge is a social commitment but not a legally binding one.

* Jack has some contact with this ... trying to bring them on an EA journey, how to be as persuasive as possible.
* Rival -- "Resource Generation' -- not effective

#### ["Legacies now"](https://legacies-now.de/en):

\> I think their name was just inspired from the idea of philanthropists who want to "leave a legacy to the world", so the org wants to help them do that soon and effectively. But I haven't seen them work on bequest fundraising. Their target audience are philanthropists giving >1M per year every year these days.

DR: Germany-based. Its a bit hard to see from their website exactly what they are doing/focused on

NB -- its a (high) fee-based model, much of which may go to salaries and support, so not necessarily good to promote widely

### Will-writing support

## GiveWell Charities, bequests, and capabilities

<details>

<summary>Sharang Phade reports</summary>

1. Most GiveWell-recommended charities accept bequests, but put nearly no effort into cultivating them or advertising them. These charities haven't seen much historical demand for this type of giving, particularly since many of these charities are newer and don't have the brand recognition of an org like Red Cross.
2. GiveWell itself, however, has planned giving project that they recently kicked off to provide more information (and possibly proactively advertise) their ability to accept bequests. This is in part a response to the \~$50M in bequest pledges they got over the last two years.
3. All in all, it probably makes sense for re-granting orgs to be accepting bequests more so than implementers directly, since global priorities may shift, and orgs like GiveWell are likely to be more resilient.
4. In speaking with Maggie Lloydhauser from the GiveWell team, we thought it could be worth pushing the strategy of considering bequests to other meta-orgs like one for the world, giving what we can, etc.
5. Finally, it doesn't seem like there's much of a technical challenge here; services like FreeWill already exist, and tracking the relatively small number of bequest pledges seems easy enough for GiveWell to handle.&#x20;

(Short blog post, slightly Reinstein-research-promotiony)
{% endembed %}

DR: My intervention approach centers around a mediation where legatees and 'testators' (parent and child) discuss their values. A 'conditional anonymity' approach might be taken, in which each states privately what outcomes/shares they would be happy with, and only the mutually-agreed-upon space is revealed to all.

## Misc notes; conversation with Jack Lewars

Jack: "ROI" on bequest funding in UK is much higher than other events, he has heard.

Interested in getting an MVP off the ground, not through OFTW.. will people give this a go? Possibly a 'one-off' thing with OfTW. Some value in offering a menu of options.

EA may be a bit too impatient for longer-term projects of fundraising (ironically ofbecause longtermism)... bequests is a long-game

FP 'gets around this' because of their legal lock..

Need to have a vehicle -- and a fund that dynamically determines where it goes

## **Going forward plans/to do**

* DR to do research
  * what orgs and tools exist and what is missing or needs pushingâ€™
  * what the applied research says .. about approaches to encouraging bequests
* JL can volunteer some time, with other volunteers to put together an MVP
* possibly -- go out in the Spring, trial with some push ... GW, LTFF, climate funds, look for the result
* if it goes well, worth considering incubation at Charity Entrpreneurship
