# ðŸ‘‹ Meet the team

We are a group of researchers and practitioners across a range of fields (Economics, Psychology, Marketing, Statistics) and organizations, particularly those interested in effective charitable giving and effective altruism. This is outlined in the [Airtable](https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=invrYLQD6MCwj5tzF\&inviteToken=756e551c2eb2be11add77811fa080f3ac80c5adc68b402c5dcbbc4a16684b836) [(invite link)](https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=invrYLQD6MCwj5tzF\&inviteToken=756e551c2eb2be11add77811fa080f3ac80c5adc68b402c5dcbbc4a16684b836), with embedded views below.

As individuals and organizations, we are goal-driven and impact-driven: we are in this to improve the world, particularly through directing funds and support to the most effective causes and interventions. Because we share these common goals, _we are better aligned for collaboration_ than typical academics and charitable organizations. We have an unprecedented opportunity to collaborate, learn what works, and 'move the needle'.
