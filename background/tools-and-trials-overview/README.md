See, and coalesce ideas from the links below (and more)

## Discussion

_How should we group, organise and categorise?_

1. Theoretical frameworks --> tool categories
2. Certain outcomes are relevant to some tools only
3. Atheoretical 'trying different marketing colors' and tools that push several buttons

## Some tools and tests of high-interest (overview, quick presentations)

## Nick Fitz: "some quick types of different tests/questions EA orgs are interested in"

* identifiable victims vs statistical (etc), (DR: Some groups have principled objections to presenting identified victims; which ones do _not?_)
* emotional vs factual/statements,
* videos v images v text,
* positive v negative valence,
* opportunity v obligation,
* cause areas (Not sure what exactly this meant)
* different framings for specific EA orgs
  * e.g., for GWWC they want to test 1% v 10% pledge asks,
  * for CES they want to test saving-democracy v representation messaging,
  * for Humane League they want to test different types of animals, etc)
