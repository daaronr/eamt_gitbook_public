# Give if you win/ conditional pledge

* Conditional pledges \(‘Give if you Win’\), esp. 
  * Work with EA orgs at universities and in companies; possibly working with 80k hours &/or FoundersPledge, give opportunity for career guidance
* Control: Ask about career goal/target, follow up in 1 year, ask for pledge then
* Treatment: Same but ask initially for conditional pledge \(‘if you attain the goal’\)

See [Give If You Win](http://giveifyouwin.org/) project \(hope to scale up evidence from smaller contexts\)
