# "Qualitative" design issues

## **Naturalness of setting versus 'pure' treatments**

Academics usually try to make each treatment differ in precisely one dimension, these treatments are meant to represent the underlying model or construct as purely as possible. This can lead to setups that appear strange or artificial, which itself might bring responses it will not be representative or generalizable.  For example, in my '[give if you win](http://giveifyouwin.org/)' \(lab\) work we had a trial that was \(paraphrasing\) 'we are asking you to commit to a donation that may or may not be collected. If the coin flips heads, we will collect the amount you commit, otherwise no donation is made'. It was meant to separate the component of the "give if you win" driven by the uncertain nature of the commitment rather than the uncertain nature of the _income_. Howeverwhen , tried to bring this to fieldexperiments, there was no way to do it without it making it obvious that this was an experiment or some very strange exercise.

When we consider an experiment providing "real impact information" to potential donors, we might be encouraged to use the exact write-up from Givewell's page, for naturalness. However, this may not present the "lives per dollar" information in exactly the same way between two charities of interest, for the ride up with me it's self suggest certain "anchors" whole numbers that people may want to contribute. Thus if we use the exact GW  language we may not be 100% confident that the provision of the impact of information is driving any difference. We might be tempted to change it. 

_There are very often tradeoffs of this sort._

## **.Awareness of testing can affect results**

We have posted about this, in general terms,  on a public forum. Thus the idea that ‘people are running experiments to promote effective giving and EA ideas’ is not a well-kept secret.  If participants in our experiments and trials are aware of this it may affect their choices and responses to treatments. Mitigating this, most of our experiments will be conducted in subtle ways \(e.g., small but meaningful variations in EA-aligned home pages\), and individuals will only see one of these \(with variation by geography or by IP-linked cookies\). Furthermore, we will conduct most of our experiments targeting non-EA-aligned audiences unlikely to read posts like this one. \(People reading this post are probably ‘already converted’.\)



## Other issues to consider and flesh out

* Universe \(population\) of interest
* Clicks \(easier to  observe, quicker feedback\)  versus meaningful long-run behaviour, and attribution issues  
* Choice of impact measure/metric
