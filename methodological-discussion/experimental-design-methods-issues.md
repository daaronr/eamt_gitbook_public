# "Quant" Experimental design methods/issues

## Resources 

The [https://declaredesign.org/](https://declaredesign.org) framework and R package seems very helpful. I (David Reinstein) am learning and trying to adapt it. 

## Randomization and blocking

### Geographic blocks versus individuals

### How to block/stratify

## What are our estimation goals?

### Statistical power versus optimized learning

### Fixed vs adaptive designs

See [adaptive design notes](adaptive-design-sampling-reinforcement-learning.md)

## Preregistration and Preanalysis plans

### Which statistical tests/methods
