# (Analysis: Statistical approaches)

## Impact of a treatment on incidence of a 'rare event'



_Notes from slack:_ \
__I’m finding some issues like this in analyzing rare events … not quite that rare, but still a few per thousand or a few per hundred.

I’m taking 2 statistical approaches to the analysis (discussion, code, and data in links):

1. [Bayesian binomial-beta (a pretty standard setup I’m probably making overcomplicated)](https://daaronr.github.io/dualprocess/analysis-questions-and-tests.html#bayes\_prop)
2. Randomization inference (simulation) … for a sort of [equivalence testing here](https://rethinkpriorities.github.io/methodology-statistics-design/inference-and-rough-equivalence-testing-with-binomial-outcomes.html#how-likely-are-proportions-this-similar-under-different-size-true-effect-sizes)

I think either of these could be ‘flipped around’ to be used for power calculation or ‘the Bayesian equivalent of power calculation’

My colleague Jamie Elsey has some expertise with the latter; [we’re putting together our discussion HERE](https://rethinkpriorities.github.io/methodology-statistics-design/power-workflow.html), although it’s mainly frequentist and not Bayesian ATM.
