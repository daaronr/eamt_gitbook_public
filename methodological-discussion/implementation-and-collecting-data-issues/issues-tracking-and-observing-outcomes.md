# Issues: tracking and observing outcomes

1. Tracking: See a page, track action afterwards
2. Putting ads on Youtube and testing click through
3. [Geographic segmentation](geographic-segmentation-blocked-randomization.md): Targeting zip codes and looking at activity from zip codesâ€¦

Other approaches include time-series and difference in difference in response to switching on or off the ad, trial, or page content
