# Targeted ad on FB, with variations: setup

_Below, we give one example from a relevant context, illustrating (with screenshots) what choices you might make,  what it would look like, and how to implement it._

__

**Targeted ad**

Suppose we wish to create a targeted ad for a particular Facebook audience.  For example, we might wish to put an ad&#x20;

* in the 'feed' of Americans whose birthday is coming up within the next week,
* giving them a link  to a page encouraging them to start a birthday fundraiser



**Version testing**

We may have several versions of the ad we want to try out, and we want Facebook to iterate towards the one that is more successful using their algorithm.  Ideally, we would like to learn  ****  as much as we can about which ads perform better on which audiences**.**&#x20;

&#x20;**** We can set up Facebook's ("meta") algorithm to dynamically optimize over which will get the most clicks.  However it might be better to have this optimize over which one gets the most "conversions on our page". To do the latterr we need to set up a "meta pixel".



**Cost and cost controls**

In my past experience, you ended up paying Facebook based on the number of "clicks" you got not simply on how long your ad was up. But it's probably a combination of these, and there are probably different pricing plans.  You can tell Facebook to put a limit on either of these do not go "over budget".
