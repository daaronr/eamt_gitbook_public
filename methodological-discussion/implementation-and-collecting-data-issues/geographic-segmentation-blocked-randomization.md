# Geographic segmentation/blocked randomization

In many contexts, the route to a meaningful outcome \(e.g., GWWC pledge\) is a long one. Attribution is difficult. An individual may have been first -influenced by \(1\) YouTube ad while seeing a video on her AppleTV, and then \(2\) by a friend's post on Facebook, and then finally moved to act \(3\) after having a conversation at a bar and \(4\) visiting the GWWC web site on her telephone. 

The same individual may not \(or may\) be trackable through 'cookies' and 'pixels' but this is already very limited and imprecise, and being made harder by new legislation.  

"Geographic targeting" of individual treatments/trials/initiatives/ads may help better track, attribute, and yield inference about 'what works'.   
  
_E.g., we might do a 'lift test':_

1. select a balanced random set of US Zip codes for a particular repeated YouTube ad promoting GWWC, the "Treated group" 
2. compare the rate of GWWC visits, email sign-ups, pledges, and donations in the next 6 months from these zip codes relative to all other zip codes. \(Possibly throwing out or finding a way to draw additional inference from zip codes adjacent to the treated group\)..

_We could also do multi-armed tests \(of several types of ad or other treatment, with a similar setup as above\)_  
 



Where and how can we geographically block treatments?
