# Methods: Overview, discussion, resources

## Sections

[qualitative-design-issues.md](qualitative-design-issues.md "mention"): How to design the 'content' of experiments and surveys to have internal validity and external generalizability&#x20;

[splits-randomization](splits-randomization/ "mention"): How to set up trials to have comparable groups

[adaptive-design-sampling-reinforcement-learning.md](adaptive-design-sampling-reinforcement-learning.md "mention"): Adjusting the treatments and design as you learn, to 'get to the highest value in the end'

[analysis-statistical-approaches.md](analysis-statistical-approaches.md "mention"): How to make inferences from the data after you have it (and plan this in advance)



## What are our estimation goals?

### Statistical power versus optimized learning

### Fixed vs adaptive designs
