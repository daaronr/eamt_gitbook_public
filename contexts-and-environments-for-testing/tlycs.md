# TLYCS

## [The Life You Can Save ](https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/)

Leads: Bilal Siddiqi, Neela Saldhana;  
Other partner contact: Jon Behar \(Giving Games\)

## Notes

Bilal has a background in evaluation research - wants to actually make them happen via donations

Neela: infrastructure…. Have to think about the infrastructure…

### Interests/possible trials

* "Obligation vs. supererogitory" \(Neela\)
* [Profiling](../profiling-and-segmentation/profiling-discussion.md)
  * TLYCS are a little bit older / more female than Givewell/GWWC
  * Who is most likely to donate overseas? People who travel…
  * Will share info from some analysis of TLYCS \(do we have this?\)

### Contexts and plans

* Target "Giving Season"
* What would be actionable:
* Drowning child vs. burning building \(EXPLAIN?\)
* How do people come into this funnel?
  * Searching for most good in the abstract
  * If somebody already has something in mind… 
  * Location: can you match location \(EXPLAIN?\)
  * Matching cause… \(EXPLAIN?\)
* Neela and Bilal were keen on targeting particularly in Australia...
* Existing research: 1. [https://twitter.com/zeitzoff/status/1415001232901562372](https://twitter.com/zeitzoff/status/1415001232901562372) 2. More likely to support harsh punishments for consequentia**l**ist reasons
* Logistics: 
  1. Barriers: basically hard to change website cos of team / technical barriers
  2. They were asking us about money
  3. But seems that advertising to get people to website is best… and there are funds

**Suggested fortnightly meeting**
