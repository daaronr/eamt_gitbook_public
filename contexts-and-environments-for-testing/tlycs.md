# TLYCS

## [The Life You Can Save ](https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/)

Leads: Bilal Siddiqi, Neela Saldhana;  
Other partner contact: Jon Behar \(Giving Games\)

### Contexts and plans

* Target "Giving Season" timing-wise
* What would be actionable?
* How do people come into this funnel?
  * Searching for most good in the abstract, then this is easy?
  * If somebody already has something in mind… 
    * Good to match the donations to a location people are interested in
    * We want to match our offering to the cause people are interested in 
* Neela and Bilal were keen on targeting particularly in Australia...
* Logistics: 
  1. Barriers: basically hard to change website cos of team / technical barriers
  2. We were discussing funding 
  3. But seems that advertising to get people to website is best… and there are funds
* "Obligation vs. supererogatory" \(Neela\)
  * Drowning child vs. burning building \[EXPLAIN\]
* [Profiling](../profiling-and-segmentation/profiling-discussion.md)
  * TLYCS are a little bit older / more female than Givewell/GWWC
  * Who is most likely to donate overseas? People who travel…
  * Neela mentioned some analysis which could be useful  in the below document
