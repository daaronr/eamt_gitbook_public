# TLYCS

## [The Life You Can Save ](https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/)

Leads: Bilal Siddiqi, Neela Saldhana;  
Other partner contact: Jon Behar \(Giving Games\)

### Contexts and plans

* Target "Giving Season" timing-wise
* What would be actionable?
* How do people come into this funnel?
  * Searching for most good in the abstract, then this is easy?
  * If somebody already has something in mind… 
    * Good to match the donations to a location people are interested in
    * We want to match our offering to the cause people are interested in 
* Neela and Bilal were keen on targeting particularly in Australia...
* Logistics: 
  1. Barriers: basically hard to change website cos of team / technical barriers
  2. We were discussing funding 
  3. But seems that advertising to get people to website is best… and there are funds
* "Obligation vs. supererogatory" \(Neela\)
  * Drowning child vs. burning building \[EXPLAIN\]
* [Profiling](../profiling-and-segmentation/profiling-discussion.md)
  * TLYCS are a little bit older / more female than Givewell/GWWC
  * Who is most likely to donate overseas? People who travel…
  * Neela mentioned some analysis which could be useful  in the below document

Bilal suggested reading this special issue: 

{% embed url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-behavioral-and-experimental-economics/vol/66/suppl/C" %}

{% hint style="info" %}
David Reinstein: The Karlan and Wood paper is particularly relevant. I see that as the first -- albeit limited and contextual -  evidence on how donors react to quantitative/scientific impact information.  My notes on this paper are [HERE](https://daaronr.github.io/ea_giving_barriers/eval-aversion.html#analytical-grinch) \(I should incorporate these into the present wiki to enable discussion and expansion\)  
  
Other papers in that issue \(some in lab settings\) also appear relevant, esp:  
- [Do people donate more when they perceive a single beneficiary whom they know? A field experimental test of the identifiability effect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214804316300179)  
[- Information and donations to development aid projects](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214804316300295) \(Lab giving to charities\)   
- Maybe:  [Nudging charitable giving: Three field experiments](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214804316300222)  
  
  
_But note that some of these papers are from 'big Economists' who normally would see "getting a paper in a JBEE special issue" as a non-success. So each paper probably has important limitations._

Bilal also talked about this intervention which involved video messages by one of the authors: ["Messages on Covid Prevention in India..."](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w27496/w27496.pdf) \(NBER\)
