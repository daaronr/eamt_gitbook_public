# Chatbot \(deferred\)

We have had conversations about building and using Chatbots with  Noah Castelo,  who has used these in his  research.   
  
**The main ideas**

* Pre-coded or gpt3-esque 'learning chatbots' 
* Convince/debate/chat people about

  * Impact-efficiency: It is better to give to charities that can do more good per $. You should do this.
  * Altruism/pledge: It is good to donate a significant share of your income \(to the effective causes\). You should do this/ 

  _Context/methods_ 

* Use to attract people to GWWC, TLYCS etc., also for people already on the site, considering a pledge, etc.
* People asked to donate to 'charity X' -- advertise "is this charity the best one you can donate to? Ask our chatbot"
* Test impact of presence/absence of chatbot
* Test different types of bots, different themes
* Structured learning helps us understand 'what arguments are working'
* Measure outcomes: Credible statements, donations, pledges, signups 

_DR, 22 Jul 2021: While this is very promising, it is likely to take a long time to build; thus we may separate this out or save it for late_

## Misc discussion on chatbots

> JL: chatbots might also be interesting as a foot in the door to getting someone to speak with a human. like a FB ad to speak with a chatbot that has an option to call a human might do better than a FB ad to call with a human
>
> DR: I like it, especially if it is not presented as ‘pawning people off on a chatbot’ or tricking them into thinking its a human
