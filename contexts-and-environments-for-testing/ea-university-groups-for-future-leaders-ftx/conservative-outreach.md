## Listening tour

### Proposed focus-group/meeting

* Contact people who reached out in the EA Forum post
* Explicit 'random recruitment'; maybe with 'Brinck'

_**With a plan and details in mind like:**_

1. What are we trying to promote, and what will it look like
2. We should have some ad copy as well as  details on ‘where the links go to’
3. What are their reactions and how do they think others will react
4. What are the key ‘issues’ with Conservatives x EA that are relevant to this
5. outline key sticking points and motivators
6. discuss opinions and experiences
7. What are practical issues that would block/help our promotion plan? (E.g., “you need  someone to announce this at XXX meetings of the campus libertarian association,” or “post it on X bulletin board” or “get these professors to endorse it”)
8. What experiences have you had discussing and promoting EA with conservatives/on conservative-leaning campuses … and what insights did you gain?
9. What are we missing or ignoring?
