## Small preliminary Facebook ads trial \~20 May

<details>

<summary>Notes on 'how it went'</summary>

&#x20;“Because of the short timeline [Pranay Mittal](https://app.gitbook.com/u/dlkjqobNGnSjjmIUpeFgfc2eMtP2 "mention") had to run ads from own account\


specified zip codes of places we want to hit and targeted students, age 18-25

Used all 14 ads (including revised climate change one) \


Pranay Had a hard time getting things like ‘instagram stories’ to work[, ](https://givingexperiments.slack.com/archives/D03C4JE1329/p1653511446662439)

\
UF should be better at this than him

</details>

Upshot of preliminary trial:  3000+ impressions, $100 (but he gave a spending limit of $1000) --> _no clicks! (needs doublechecking)_\

<summary>Next steps/<strong>Follow ups:</strong><br></summary>

1. Why did it stop?
2. What was missing here like instagram stories that UF can help with?
3. instagram, description and title etc.
4. Can we see the ads ourselves from the PoV of the user
5. Can we follow up with users? Any feedback would be reasonable. Any comments at all or any people who mentioned this? … how can we engineer this, like a very small demo we can reach out to?
6. Are we sure we are getting the metrics correct?

_Video would help — can we make this happen soon? Scrappy is good._ (edited)&#x20;
