## Key issues and priorities

1. Cost and value of advertising on different platforms
2. &#x20;Understanding how well advertising will scale, at what point do the cross the cost effectiveness threshold
3. Scaling/success as we expand (ads etc) to larger groups of universities (Tier 1, Tier 2, etc) ...&#x20;
4. (Maybe) Which messages and themes work best? &#x20;

Various procedural and [implementation-questions.md](../../core-knowledge-base/marketing-implementation-and-practical-tips/implementation-questions.md "mention"), e.g.,&#x20;

Maybe out of our scope: "What should be the bar for receiving 80k careers advice?"

### Targets (outcomes)

**Engagement with 80k**

* &#x20;**** Subscribe to 80 Newsletter, Podcast, etc
* Apply for career guidance

**Awareness**&#x20;

> Over multiple campaigns, we hope to make “80,000 Hours” a top answer to the question “where do you go for career advice?”

**Career changes**

But this is a long term outcome, hard to measure, slow feedback loop
