# 80000 hours

## Key issues and priorities

1. What channels work best for 80k? (Big question)&#x20;
2. Cost and value of advertising on different platforms
3. Understanding how well advertising will scale, at what point does it cross the cost-effectiveness threshold
4. Scaling/success as we expand (ads etc) to larger groups of universities (Tier 1, Tier 2, etc) ...&#x20;
5. (Maybe) Which messages and themes work best? &#x20;

Various procedural and [implementation-questions.md](../../core-knowledge-base/marketing-implementation-and-practical-tips/implementation-questions.md "mention"), e.g., Youtube sponsorship vs ads.&#x20;

Maybe out of our scope: "What should be the bar for receiving 80k careers advice?"

### Targets (outcomes)

**Engagement with 80k**

* Subscribe to 80 Newsletter, Podcast, etc
* Engagement time on web site, time reading the articles&#x20;
  * (Be aware of counter-metrics)



**Middle of funnel**

* Job board
* Apply for career guidance

**Over-arching Awareness**&#x20;

> Over multiple campaigns, we hope to make “80,000 Hours” a top answer to the question “where do you go for career advice?”

**Career changes ('plan changes')**

But this is a long term outcome, hard to measure, slow feedback loop ...&#x20;

Ad hoc idea: Median 2 year lag, 5-6 year upper end&#x20;
