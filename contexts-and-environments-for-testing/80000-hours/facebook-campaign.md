# Facebook campaign

**Key focus and elements** (pasted in from Gdoc linked below ... while it is private)

_Trial goal:_ Generate signups (from our target audience) to the 80,000 Hours newsletter (-> get more engaged readers -> achieve career ‘plan changes’)

_Who will be targeted or who do you expect to be part of the trial?_ University students and recent graduates (age 18-30) from universities in our ‘tier 1, 2 and 3’ list.\
\
_Hypotheses that we will test:_

* Facebook & Instagram ads are a promising marketing channel for 80,000 Hours, generating newsletter subscribers from our target audience at below $30/sub
* DR: “What is the ‘cost per newsletter-subscription’ from using these ads?”\

* We will see diminishing returns to the ads as we scale. At some level of annualised ad spend, the ads will no longer be cost effective
* “How does the ‘cost per newsletter-subscription’  change as we increase the ad expenditure in this context, and at what point does it cross the cost-effectiveness threshold of $30/per
* Targeting a smaller audience will be more expensive&#x20;
* Targeting our list of ‘tier 1’ universities will be more expensive than ‘tier 2’ than ‘tier 3’
* DR: “Are higher-tier universities more costly to target (per-impression, per-click, per-subscription)?”
