# Facebook campaign

**Key focus and elements** (pasted in from Gdoc linked below ... while it is private)

_Trial goal:_ Generate signups (from our target audience) to the 80,000 Hours newsletter (-> get more engaged readers -> achieve career ‘plan changes’)

_Who will be targeted or who do you expect to be part of the trial?_ University students and recent graduates (age 18-30) from universities in our ‘tier 1, 2 and 3’ list.\
\
_**Hypotheses that we will test:**_

* Facebook & Instagram ads are a promising marketing channel for 80,000 Hours, generating newsletter subscribers from our target audience at below $30/sub
  * _DR operationalization: “What is the ‘cost per newsletter-subscription’ from using these ads?”_
* We will see diminishing returns to the ads as we scale. At some level of annualised ad spend, the ads will no longer be cost effective
  * _DR operationalization_: “How does the ‘cost per newsletter-subscription’ change as we increase the ad expenditure in this context, and at what point does it cross the cost-effectiveness threshold of $30/per
* Targeting a smaller audience will be more expensive
* Targeting our list of ‘tier 1’ universities will be more expensive than ‘tier 2’ than ‘tier 3’
  * _DR operationalization_: “Are higher-tier universities more costly to target (per-impression, per-click, per-subscription)?”

<summary>Some notes on the above campaign results (sketch)</summary>

The question of 'when they cross to threshold holding creative constant': It does so quickly with the initial creatives

(We don't know which dimensions this is working on, we don't get to see the list FB goes down.) Some signs/intuition that it was fatiguing people ... they got some complaints. \
Responded by removing people with EA Forum accounts from the list. &#x20;

The CW is that the optimal number of times to hit people with is 2x per week.

number of people in the set was millions, number who browse was smaller; at select unis and recent graduates

...

Now switching out the creative; can we do stuff to reach the audience cost-effectively.You can only put in 10 creatives at a time. DR: But you could optimize across the margins.

A few successful options... more recent 'spanner' is video assets ... they worked better than the static. Making some video assets.

It is tough to know what the "output" is.
