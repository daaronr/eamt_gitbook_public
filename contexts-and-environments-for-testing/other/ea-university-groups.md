# EA university groups

### [EA Groups survey](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Q4aF9T5PuBM2akxp6/ea-groups-survey-2020) (CEA)

### Miranda and Michelle at the University of Chicago

They have an interesting set of initiatives. They are hoping to\


1. Survey EA Uni groups and report on what outreach approaches they take (I encouraged them to also try to get even anecdotal reports on how successful these have been)
   1. But note the [EA Groups Survey](ea-university-groups.md#undefined) may cover some of this already
2. Run some marketing experiments at U Chicago into:
3. What approach (in postering, emails, digital ads) gets people to come to an EA info session?
4. What emphasis at the info session gets people to apply to the Fellowship?

_The three thematic approaches they are considering are_\
__i. The standard intellectual “here’s what EA is and why is it important”\
ii. A career based approach … ‘how EA can help you do the most good with your career’\
iii. An approach that will be ‘more friendly to progressives’. I encouraged them to consider issues of ‘how to track data’ doing a sort of ‘informal preregistration’ to fix their ideas, and to consider the impacts on medium and long-term outcomes, not just ‘which gets the most people in for a free hat.’
