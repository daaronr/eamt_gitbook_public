# GiveWell

## Notes on conversation with Jason Anderson -- need organizing

### Jason's role, experience 

Jason Anderson was brought in to focus on retention of under 10k donors. Marketing was charged with rebranding them to capture a broader share of the market  
  
Thinks people give according to a certain cycle.  


### What Givewell has done and is willing to do 

* Did some segmentation and some message testing. 
* Focusing on retention and moving people up through the chain. Lots of 'opens' but few responses to emails.  

Interested in putting more into podcasts. Assumes they are open to collab subject to privacy restrictions.

_GiveWell is incredibly careful about what they are willing to say and how_

#### Messaging

*  Shifted towards a 'donor-focused message' -- but didn't test it, it just seemed obvious
* **Newsletter** that is research focused, 
* impact emails... --&gt; Big effect on open rate but hard to follow further

3 months of treatment/control group with some additional communications, at least 1-2 solicitations, event invitation. A substantial impact on retention and amount gave a bit.  


#### Advertising/Promotion and tracking/testing

* Podcasts are the major success 
* But haven't been doing much testing in those areas Sourcing donations when they come to website, followup survey in terms of 'where you found us'

#### Limitations

_GiveWell is incredibly careful about what they are willing to say and how_

* Finds "identifiable victim" marketing to be exploitive/slimey.
* Outreach: changed privacy policy without notice ... \[?\]
*  Limitations on what we are willing to say and how... 'we search for the charities that save or improve lives per dollar'. All about factual and scientific accuracy.

Focus groups, very helpful to be exposed to data and other organizations' experience

Focus on donors 'what is impact and what is important to them'

Shifted strategy to focus on higher-value donors after an influx of lower-value donors

...

If we have a followup meeting lets include some of our marketing groups

research constraints ... RFM+ giving capacity

Highest groups will get most attention

### Profiling

Marketing side has not been going into profiling and finding new markets as a marketer knowing the 'target market demo' isn't enough; wants to know what channels they use  


### Possibilities

  
"Worth knowing more about Open Phil grants .. there being onboard might be convincing to GW \(or vice/versa?\). OP are more willing to look into things outside the normal space.

'Ship your database of existing customers up to epsilon etc'

Doubling new donors, we are doing really well, something is working, how do we do that better? Or 'are we looking to open up new markets'?
