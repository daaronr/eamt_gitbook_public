# (Charity Elections)

## Below, some miscellaneous notes which need condensing and organization

**Notes:** Greg’s Charity Elections program has received funding from EAIF, they’re keen to test the model and could probably do with some help on evaluation.&#x20;

“The pilot was approved”&#x20;

You can follow back through the ecosystem … when many of the students are at university\


notes with adam steinberg, charity elections, applying for OP funding

Was TLYCS, now GWWC

link: [EA forum post](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/yNXfF4LoFps7Mi4Dr/movement-building-charity-elections-for-high-schoolers) on this project

Sees outreach initiatives in the works, increasing; orgs such as OftW and 'Probably good'

Idea: We need to test what works because if there is no evidence then someone will do the marketing without the evidence and do it wrong and poison the waters

As a teacher: If you complicate an idea people run away with it



### Charity elections; applying for Open Phil funding

'If we get funded, will be working with the charity elections program in High schools' 3 in US and 3 outside the US, Spain, England, Israel

... this grew out of Giving games ... aligning with GWWC

bend the curve of giving towards effectiveness giving

#### Details

Part of the goal is to soften up people to the idea of evidence based philanthropy

Making it 'self-sufficient' for schools

* Kids run it, can get leadership certif.

There is 'manual' (Greg)

* they learn about 3 charities, some ideas around effective giving. Schools have the 2k from GwwC
* ... all 3 charities are effective ... disparity, idea is poverty, animals, and a \[last year max-impact fund]?
* in social studies classes, but wants it to be made more real
* all 3 get something but one usually wins out, can choose 70/20/10 or allocate based on actual vote.
* ? what share participate ... usually social studies wide
* each ballot worth 2 USD ... others don't go
* Funds are coming from GWWC

Track record:

Run at 1 school by Greg Geonapolis ... 9 schools so far ... gathering data ... a pre/post survey. Not longitudinal.

#### Goals/outcomes/metrics/objects of study

How do they quote the 'feelings they have'

When the election is over, there is an option for students to continue. Track that. A list of 'memes' ... some lasting

What are the key/first messages for people to get?

What 'seeds do we want to plant'?

T wo goals/missions ... masses vs key leaders... DR thinks there might be some tension here.

In talks with Open Phil. Wants to make sure that a key goal is to find the cream of the crop ... the future 80k kids.

DR: To me it's mainly about domestic vs international

#### Scaling and funding possibilities...

Are we sponsoring every school or? Make the case that we are 'borrowing the money'.

Funding, especially in the absence of OP, can do this as a 'donation pass through' tick box on GiveWell, GWWC etc.

Should partner with a portfolio or EtG group ...

"Are you OK with having it be used for philanthropy education"

Better "Are you OK with having the exact allocation determined by students, among these charities, with an added benefit for philanthropy education'?

Political issue? ... DR suggests engaging with church education and parochial schools too, perhaps

#### Sharing with EG marketing team?

Yes, and ... this is an opportunity to develop a market research... but present it in a way that has direct benefits in the main, not only 'learning benefits'

I can ask GG about data collection and evidence, ... and what's the best mix of charities

DR: We should work together/share resources in either case. the EG Marketing team is about trying and promoting new things, not just about scientific learning

## Follow on meeting with Greg Gianopoulos

How many sessions have their been?

6 sessions in 2021

correcting 'misconceptions'

Each charity has a video

New video for humane league to avoid controversy

Students have a bunch of responses ... 'evaluating the effectiveness'

They do a pre-event survey

'Rate the importance of the below" ... compassionate, critical thinking, making world better, thinkimg creatively

How much time have uyou spend talking about world iussues, researching nonprofits

I suggested considering ways of doing feedback

They were asked if they would be interested in participaitng in a group in the future, taking a leadership role, etc. Some schools collected names, others initials

An EA funds page: students could donate to their own school's elections ... more came from communities than from GWWC

Target of 15-40 schools... I suggested doing it with moe

Currently networking through EA ... should go further to provide this for social science teachers etc

His assumption is that there are few if any EA groups in HS

Randomization at 2 levels (counties you reach out to) ... and then perhaps randomization among those that accept for staggered administration

Compare the 'uncontacted' vs 'all contacted' and track EA participation 1+ years later in surveys that ask people what county they went to HS in\
