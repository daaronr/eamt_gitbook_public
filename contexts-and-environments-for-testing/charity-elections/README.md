### Program Overview

Simply put: students in High School social studies classes (entire school, usually)  learn about 3 charities, and are presented some ideas around effective giving.  The Schools have the 2k (from GWWC) to disburse. All 3 charities are effective, but represent a range of causes ... usually  poverty, animals, and a \[last year max-impact fund]. They then 'vote', with each ballot worth 2 USD.   All 3 charities get something but one usually wins out. Schools (?)  can choose whehter to allocate it  70/20/10 depending on vote shares, or to  allocate based on actual vote.

There have only been a fairly small number of schools/sessions (e.g., 6 sessions in 2021), but they are planning to expand, and have some funding and support.&#x20;

## Trajectory

> Giving What We Can suggested the rough target of increasing the reach of the program from six schools and 2,000 students in 2021 to 15-40 schools and 10,000+ students in 2022. (Greg)

* applying for Open Phil funding (granted?)
* 'If we get funded, will be working with the charity elections program in High schools' 3 in US and 3 outside the US, Spain, England, Israel'
* Part of the goal is to soften up people to the idea of evidence based philanthropy
* Making it 'self-sufficient' for schools
  * Kids run it, can get leadership certif.
