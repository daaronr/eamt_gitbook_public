## Some key questions (Greg Gianopoulos)

> Thanks in advance for considering this when you get the chance. A couple months ago Adam and I drafted three key messages/memes that participating schools might take away from the program, and I am working on incorporating an open-ended question into the Voter Registration Form and Voting Ballot that would contribute to measuring impact.&#x20;

1. &#x20;We can make a positive impact in the world, and a powerful way to do this is through giving and giving effectively.&#x20;
2. &#x20;The most effective charities make an enormous difference in the lives of others at a small cost.&#x20;
3. I know how to use research to find charities that are impactful and evidence-backed.

> Based on the key messages, what do you think about the question, **"If you were given $100 to give to charity, how would you decide where to donate?**" I was thinking that results of that question (or a similar version) might be sent to EAMT without indicating which school or if the results were collected before/after the event, if you would be willing and interested in performing some form of analysis with that data.

_**DR quick responses/questions**_&#x20;

I am not sure what you are hoping to get out of this, I'd like to operationalize it more.  The question seems pretty good as a starting point, but as you might suspect, I'm sometimes skeptical about drawing too much inference from completely hypothetical questions. Still, I think this is something the EAMT might be interested in helping analyze, and I think other researchers on the team may be more familiar with using qualitative, free-response and hypothetical choice data.

But _how do those 'messages' interact with the questions? Can you clarify? Are you asking them to weigh in on the messages? Does everyone get every message?_

1. What 'control schools' do we have in mind here? (The before/after could also be nice, though.)
2. How much delay would there be between the program and this open-ended question?
3. Could this _also_ involve real money? (I suspect the funds are out there)
4. Could this involve the students' own money or another meaningful commitment (e.g., knowing they will be contacted to follow up if they leave an email).&#x20;
   1. (But  if it is hypothetical anyways, why not imagine a larger amount)/
5. In general terms,  what do we hope to look for in this open-ended somewhat qualitative set of responses? (If we define it specifically we can probably pre-plan entry register an approach to avoid wishful thinking in doing the analysis).&#x20;
   1. Note: I think I suggested the 'open-ended questions could be good' earlier, though, as it could somewhat minimize the experimenter demand and acquiescence bias stuff, especially if there is a 'time separation from the program)



_DR: Some key concerns and questions  (echoing my earlier comments)_

* To avoid acquiescence bias and other forms of "experimenter demand" should be careful about presenting this too closely to the charity election
* Are we getting at responses people will see as "meaningful"? Perhaps the 'mode of reasoning, if not immediately prompted by the program' could be very interesting.&#x20;

## Meeting notes

&#x20;_(These need condensing/organization)_

**Notes:** Greg’s Charity Elections program has received funding from EAIF, they’re keen to test the model and could probably do with some help on evaluation.&#x20;

“The pilot was approved”&#x20;

You can follow back through the ecosystem … when many of the students are at university\


### Notes with Adam Steinberg, charity elections, applying for OP funding

Was TLYCS funded, now GWWC

Sees outreach initiatives in the works, increasing; orgs such as OftW and 'Probably good'

Idea: We need to test what works because if there is no evidence then someone will do the marketing without the evidence and do it wrong and poison the waters

As a teacher: If you complicate an idea people run away with it



### Charity elections; applying for Open Phil funding

'If we get funded, will be working with the charity elections program in High schools' 3 in US and 3 outside the US, Spain, England, Israel

... this grew out of Giving games ... aligning with GWWC

bend the curve of giving towards effectiveness giving

#### Details

Part of the goal is to soften up people to the idea of evidence based philanthropy

Making it 'self-sufficient' for schools

* Kids run it, can get leadership certif.

There is 'manual' (Greg)

* they learn about 3 charities, some ideas around effective giving. Schools have the 2k from GwwC
* ... all 3 charities are effective ... disparity, idea is poverty, animals, and a \[last year max-impact fund]?
* in social studies classes, but wants it to be made more real
* all 3 get something but one usually wins out, can choose 70/20/10 or allocate based on actual vote.
* ? what share participate ... usually social studies wide
* each ballot worth 2 USD ... others don't go
* Funds are coming from GWWC

Track record:

Run at 1 school by Greg Geonopolis ... 9 schools so far ... gathering data ... a pre/post survey. Not longitudinal.

#### Goals/outcomes/metrics/objects of study

How do they quote the 'feelings they have'

When the election is over, there is an option for students to continue. Track that. A list of 'memes' ... some lasting

What are the key/first messages for people to get?

What 'seeds do we want to plant'?

Two goals/missions ... masses vs key leaders... DR thinks there might be some tension here.

In talks with Open Phil. Wants to make sure that a key goal is to find the cream of the crop ... the future 80k kids.

DR: To me it's mainly about domestic vs international

#### Scaling and funding possibilities...

Are we sponsoring every school or? Make the case that we are 'borrowing the money'.

Funding, especially in the absence of OP, can do this as a 'donation pass through' tick box on GiveWell, GWWC etc.

Should partner with a portfolio or EtG group ...

"Are you OK with having it be used for philanthropy education"

Better "Are you OK with having the exact allocation determined by students, among these charities, with an added benefit for philanthropy education'?

Political issue? ... DR suggests engaging with church education and parochial schools too, perhaps

#### Sharing with EG marketing team?

Yes, and ... this is an opportunity to develop a pice of market research... but present it in a way that has direct benefits in the main, not only 'learning benefits'

I can ask GG about data collection and evidence, ... and what's the best mix of charities

DR: We should work together/share resources in either case. the EG Marketing team is about trying and promoting new things, not just about scientific learning

## Follow-on meeting with Greg Gianopoulos

How many sessions have their been?

6 sessions in 2021

Correcting 'misconceptions'

Each charity has a video

New video for humane league to avoid controversy

Students have a bunch of responses ... 'evaluating the effectiveness'

They do a pre-event survey

'Rate the importance of the below"&#x20;

* ... compassionate,&#x20;
* critical thinking,&#x20;
* making world better, thinking creatively

How much time have you spent talking about world iussues, researching nonprofits



**I suggested considering more ways of doing feedback that get at more costly actions**

They were asked if they would be interested in participitng in a group in the future, taking a leadership role, etc. Some schools collected names, others initials

An EA funds page: students could donate to their own school's elections ... more came from communities than from GWWC

Target of 15-40 schools... I suggested doing it with more

Currently networking through EA ... should go further to provide this for social science teachers etc

His assumption is that there are few if any EA groups in HS

Randomization at 2 levels (counties you reach out to) ... and then perhaps randomization among those that accept for staggered administration

Compare the 'uncontacted' vs 'all contacted' and track EA participation 1+ years later in surveys that ask people what county they went to HS in\
