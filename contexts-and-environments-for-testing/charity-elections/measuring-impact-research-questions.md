<summary>Greg: Thoughts on Measuring Impact, responding to EA Funds</summary>

In correspondence with EA Funds, we were asked to respond to the question, "Can you be more concrete about how Charity Elections generates impact, and how you plan on measuring this in 2022?"

_Please see our response to that question pasted below._ After checking in with Luke, he mentioned the possibility of doing (v) with a closed-ended question instead of the open-ended question, "If you were given $100 to donate to charity, how would you decide where to donate?"\
\
Some of the factors do not serve to measure impact from the standpoint of effective giving but do serve to provide teachers with data that is relevant to schools, as exemplified in the short video linked above.\
\
All participating students are provided an EA framework for understanding charity effectiveness, and students implementing the flagship program (voting ballots, 'I Voted' stickers, etc.) are also provided an EA framework for understanding cause prioritisation. \
...

\
Given the variety of outcomes that are relevant to effective altruism as well as the participatory role that students and teachers hold in the process, the framework that has been used to measure impact has been Comprehensive Mixed-Methods Participatory Evaluation (CMMPE). The six basic assumptions of that framework are as follows: "program success is dynamic and multi-dimensional; definitions and perspectives of program success are likely to vary among stakeholders; program evaluation has multiple purposes; comprehensive program evaluation requires mixed qualitative-quantitative methods; comprehensive program evaluation requires participation of stakeholders; and comprehensive program evaluation requires advanced planning and is integral to service delivery" (Nastasi & Hitchcock, 2008).\
\
As a graduate student in School Psychology, I believe the program not only generates impact from the standpoint of directly increasing the number of young people who are exposed to principles of effective altruism, but as noted in the assumptions of CMMPE may also be valuable to other stakeholders. For social studies teachers, the event promotes youth voice and civic engagement and inspires critical and creative thinking; for school psychologists and school administrators, the event promotes compassion and positive school climate; for student leaders, the event offers a unique service leadership opportunity, training in effective altruism, and experience for college applications; and for effective altruists, the event serves to introduce a large number of high schoolers to principles of effective altruism in a way that is consistent with their development as young people and learners, deeply honoring their voice in the research, discussion and voting process, and can be used to forge sustained connections between talented young people and EA. Since the event offers benefits to stakeholders in educational communities as well as the EA community, the event can attract students and teachers who do not have prior experience with effective altruism and might be introduced to its principles through a Charity Election.\

**... Here is a list of some of the key outcomes measured:**

****\
**(i)** Number of students/teachers trained in EA frameworks (e.g. [cause prioritisation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JUx6fL7-ngC9C7Gl1mIO053GRUba8Qtb/view), [charity effectiveness](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18tosVcNymYZfArfd0Q7offgyu1IUHNL6/view?usp=sharing))\
\
**(ii)** Number of student leaders running the program and earning [Service Leadership Certificates](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Bdqcp960vTELuiSV6j\_lwCquWgNi00US/view?usp=sharing) (e.g. 28 student leaders in 2021)\
\
**(iii)** Work produced by students and teachers (e.g. [articles](https://balcattashs.wa.edu.au/charity-election/), [Instagram pages](https://www.instagram.com/explocharityevent/), [student clubs](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lA20PRV9FOvdGDXXcb\_43SkLcVuKy7Me/view), community fundraising)\
\
**(iv)** Testimonials from students and teachers (e.g. student testimonials on the [webpage](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/events/guides/charity-elections/) and a few teacher testimonials below) ****&#x20;

<summary>Some testimonials below</summary>

"Pupils at The Perse School in Cambridgeshire thoroughly enjoyed being involved with Giving What We Can’s Charity Elections. The sixth form Charities Committee decided to divide up into three teams to research the charities and do a short pitch to convince pupils to vote for their selected charity. This was such a valuable exercise for the pupils who perhaps hadn’t thought about why you might choose one charity over another and it allowed in-depth discussion of how important cost-effectiveness is and how you might measure impact. Inclusion of The Humane League as an option to be selected also prompted a discussion surrounding the idea of expanding our moral circle and how much importance we place on animal suffering. Feedback from pupils in the rest of the school was very positive, and they appreciated being asked directly about their views."\
\
"I think the charity election was a phenomenal success / experience for our kids and I'm even hoping to take part again next year if it's an option! I think it was an incredible way to very straightforwardly introduce the concept of EA and in a context that made the underlying theme of measuring impact that much more clear since students actually got to vote on what would be most impactful for them."\
\
“I was impressed with the Northfield High School charity election conducted in our Social Studies classes this past December. Students and teachers were given a great opportunity to discuss personal responsibility about worldwide issues. Researching a charity and casting a vote that includes actual funds to the winning charity gave students a chance to truly practice what it means to be ‘global citizens.’” - Kevin Dahle, Civics teacher, former Minnesota state senator, Minnesota Alliance With Youth board member\

**(v)** Differences in attitudes to charitable giving between pre-event survey and post-event survey\


</details>

<details>

<summary>The relative importance of the six considerations below were measured by The Life You Can Save:</summary>

\- Having a high positive impact per dollar donated **(increase in relative importance)**\
****- Supported by evidence on the effectiveness of its work **(increase in relative importance)**\
****- Tackling one of the world's most critical problems\
\- Spending the majority of its funds on the cause, not its own running costs\
\- Helping people in my \[particular] community **(decrease in relative importance)**\
****- Working on an issue I have a personal connection to\


</details>

\
**(vi)** Differences in rated importance of student values\
At both schools implementing a comprehensive event with \~700 students and pre/post surveys in 2021, students showed an increase in all four measured outcomes below:\
\- Being compassionate is important to me\
\- Thinking critically is important to me\
\- Thinking creatively is important to me\
\- Making the world a better place is important to me\
\
**(vii)** Percentage of students indicating agreement with statements about the event

> For example, at three of the six schools in 2021, 100% of participating students indicated they voted for a cause they believe in. At the remaining three schools, 98%, 97%, and 95% of students indicated they voted for a cause they believe in. Students consistently indicated they “thought critically about what makes a charity effective” and “felt a sense of purpose or meaning.”

\
**(viii)** Number of email subscriptions to EA-related organisations\
In 2019, there were hundreds of email subscriptions made to The Life You Can Save and One for the World at a rate of approximately two subscriptions per five participating students. Through partnership with Lucius Caviola several schools have been provided a special matching code with Giving Multiplier, and we also provided schools with Giving What We Can's [Effective](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/giving-guide/)[ Giving Guide](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/giving-guide/).\
\
**(ix)** Interviews from student leaders (e.g. [report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13avkJoQGNt\_omXxEebe-7RICl4\_KVeMe/view?usp=sharing) from the AP Government class at Northfield High School)

<summary>Interviews/questions...</summary>

After running a Charity Election, student leaders have conducted interviews with 50+ students and shared their findings with Giving What We Can. Here are sample interview questions written by student leaders in an IB Philosophy class:\
\- What do you think about the Charity Elections week? Did you learn anything new?\
\- Which do you think was the most important part in the Charity Elections (the presentations, the voting itself, the discussion, etc.)?\
\- Have the elections brought about any change in your attitude towards making donations? Why/why not?\
\- Had you donated before? If the answer is “yes”, how was this experience different?\
\- Would you like to take part in more activities like this one in the future? How and why?

\
**(x)** Ongoing engagement\
In 2022, we also intend to develop a mechanism by which we can track the most promising students in the medium- and long-term to gauge lasting counterfactual impact in terms of engagement with EA or involvement in EA-aligned activities.\
\
**(xi)** University mentorship\
In 2022, we might also measure impact by gathering feedback from university EA groups supporting high schoolers in setting up an ongoing EA club.

#### DR: 'more costly actions', more meaningful outcomes, careful RCTs**, longer follow-ups**

<details>

<summary><strong>I suggested considering more ways of doing feedback that get at more costly actions</strong></summary>

They were asked if they would be interested in participatng in a group in the future, taking a leadership role, etc. Some schools collected names, others initials...

An EA funds page: students could donate to their own school's elections ... more came from communities than from GWWC

Target of 15-40 schools... I suggested doing it with more

Currently networking through EA ... should go further to provide this for social science teachers etc

His assumption is that there are few if any EA groups in HS

Randomization at 2 levels (counties you reach out to) ... and then perhaps randomization among those that accept for staggered administration

Compare the 'uncontacted' vs 'all contacted' and track EA participation 1+ years later in surveys that ask people what county they went to HS in

## Key research questions/considered approaches

### Which "meme/message" works best ... open-ended question response&#x20;

_Notes from Greg Gianopoulos, repackaged_

> A couple months ago Adam and I drafted three key messages/memes that participating schools might take away from the program, and I am working on incorporating an open-ended question into the Voter Registration Form and Voting Ballot that would contribute to measuring impact.&#x20;

1. &#x20;We can make a positive impact in the world, and a powerful way to do this is through giving and giving effectively.&#x20;
2. &#x20;The most effective charities make an enormous difference in the lives of others at a small cost.&#x20;
3. I know how to use research to find charities that are impactful and evidence-backed.

> Based on the key messages, what do you think about the question, **"If you were given $100 to give to charity, how would you decide where to donate?**" I was thinking that results of that question (or a similar version) might be sent to EAMT without indicating which school or if the results were collected before/after the event, if you would be willing and interested in performing some form of analysis with that data.

<details>

<summary><em><strong>DR responses/questions and advising on the above (in fold)</strong></em></summary>

I am not sure what you are hoping to get out of this, I'd like to operationalize it more.  The question seems pretty good as a starting point, but as you might suspect, I'm sometimes skeptical about drawing too much inference from completely hypothetical questions. Still, I think this is something the EAMT might be interested in helping analyze, and I think other researchers on the team may be more familiar with using qualitative, free-response and hypothetical choice data.

But _how do those 'messages' interact with the questions? Can you clarify? Are you asking them to weigh in on the messages? Does everyone get every message?_

1. What 'control schools' do we have in mind here? (The before/after could also be nice, though.)
2. How much delay would there be between the program and this open-ended question?
3. Could this _also_ involve real money? (I suspect the funds are out there)
4. Could this involve the students' own money or another meaningful commitment (e.g., knowing they will be contacted to follow up if they leave an email).&#x20;
   1. (But  if it is hypothetical anyways, why not imagine a larger amount)/
5. In general terms,  what do we hope to look for in this open-ended somewhat qualitative set of responses? (If we define it specifically we can probably pre-plan entry register an approach to avoid wishful thinking in doing the analysis).&#x20;
   1. Note: I think I suggested the 'open-ended questions could be good' earlier, though, as it could somewhat minimize the experimenter demand and acquiescence bias stuff, especially if there is a 'time separation from the program)

</details>

<details>

<summary>Key concerns (DR) i. acquiescence bias, ii. are responses meaningful or cheap talk?</summary>

* To avoid acquiescence bias and other forms of "experimenter demand" should be careful about presenting this too closely to the charity election

<!---->

* Are we getting at responses people will see as "meaningful"? Perhaps the 'mode of reasoning, if not immediately prompted by the program' could be very interesting.&#x20;
