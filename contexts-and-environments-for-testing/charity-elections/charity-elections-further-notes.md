# Charity Elections (further notes to organize)



## Meeting notes (Reinstein)

&#x20;_(These need condensing/organization)_

**Notes:** Greg’s Charity Elections program has received funding from EAIF, they’re keen to test the model and could probably do with some help on evaluation.&#x20;

“The pilot was approved”&#x20;

You can follow back through the ecosystem … when many of the students are at university\


### Notes with Adam Steinberg, charity elections, applying for OP funding

Was TLYCS funded, now GWWC



Sees outreach initiatives in the works, increasing; orgs such as OftW and 'Probably good'

Idea: We need to test what works because if there is no evidence then someone will do the marketing without the evidence and do it wrong and poison the waters

As a teacher: If you complicate an idea people run away with it



## Some meeting

#### Goals/outcomes/metrics/objects of study

How do they quote the 'feelings they have'

When the election is over, there is an option for students to continue. Track that. A list of 'memes' ... some lasting

What are the key/first messages for people to get?

What 'seeds do we want to plant'?

Two goals/missions ... masses vs key leaders... DR thinks there might be some tension here.

In talks with Open Phil. Wants to make sure that a key goal is to find the cream of the crop ... the future 80k kids.

DR: To me it's mainly about domestic vs international

#### Scaling and funding possibilities...

Are we sponsoring every school or? Make the case that we are 'borrowing the money'.

Funding, especially in the absence of OP, can do this as a 'donation pass through' tick box on GiveWell, GWWC etc.

Should partner with a portfolio or EtG group ...

"Are you OK with having it be used for philanthropy education"

Better "Are you OK with having the exact allocation determined by students, among these charities, with an added benefit for philanthropy education'?

Political issue? ... DR suggests engaging with church education and parochial schools too, perhaps

#### Sharing with EG marketing team?

Yes, and ... this is an opportunity to develop a pwice of market research... but present it in a way that has direct benefits in the main, not only 'learning benefits'

I can ask GG about data collection and evidence, ... and what's the best mix of charities

DR: We should work together/share resources in either case. the EG Marketing team is about trying and promoting new things, not just about scientific learning

## Follow-on meeting with Greg Gianopoulos

How many sessions have there been?

6 sessions in 2021

Correcting 'misconceptions'

Each charity has a video

New video for humane league to avoid controversy

Students have a bunch of responses ... 'evaluating the effectiveness'

They do a pre-event survey

'Rate the importance of the below"&#x20;

* ... compassionate,&#x20;
* critical thinking,&#x20;
* making world better, thinking creatively

How much time have you spent talking about world issues, researching nonprofits
