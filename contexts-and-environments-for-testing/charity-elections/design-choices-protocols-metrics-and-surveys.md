# Design choices: Protocols, metrics and surveys

## Surveys: "Voter registration" and "Voting ballot"

Proposed content:&#x20;

[Voter Registration Form (2022 format)](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/FFY5B73).

[Voting Ballot (2022 format)](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/FN9Z5DP).





### Context

{% hint style="info" %}
When are these asked? Time difference? Attrition? Is it repeated on the same students from year to year or pre/post to measure impact?
{% endhint %}

### Goals of this survey

There are six primary goals that were considered in the drafted selection of questions:&#x20;

1. prompting student reflection
2. facilitating voting _\[DR: I guess you mean like 'registering to ensure you are legit?]_
3. &#x20;contributing to research&#x20;
4. measuring impact&#x20;
5. &#x20;collecting data relevant to schools _\[DR: not sure what this is ... or how it's distinct from 6]_
6. providing opportunities for continued learning _\[DR: how?]_

> The primary purposes of the subscales would include (a) prompting student reflection on concepts related to effective giving at the beginning of voting week and (b) if it is cleared, contributing to research by Lucius and Matti. The subscales are included on the second page of the [Voter Registration Form (2022 format)](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/FFY5B73).

> Although the subscale scores might be associated with other data (e.g. subscribing to EA-related newsletters or receiving a copy of Doing Good Better), the purpose of their inclusion (besides prompting student reflection) would be primarily for the subscale data in itself.



### Discussion of content (of particular interest\_

#### First page of Voter registration form

> GG: In regard to the first item, my thought was that it captures the "**giving significantly**" portion of the GWWC mission. It would be listed exactly as described in the expansive altruism subscale. \[I.e., it was used in that scale.]

> GG: In regard to the second item, my thought was that it captures the "**giving effectively**" portion of the GWWC mission. It would be adjusted to incorporate the prompt at the beginning of the effectiveness-focus subscale.

> David Reinstein. These seem reasonable and useful to me. For the second question, I wonder why you use only $100. Why not $500 or $1000?  \
> \
> And why 'if I were given' ... rather than 'if I were donating'? The 'given money' may convey a different sense of obligation to be effective with someone else's money, or to honor their preferences and wishes. (I'm not so against it though, I can imagine a decent argument for this.)



On the first page of the voting ballot (required) and first page of the voter registration form (required), there is room for 3-6 items that prompt student reflection and contribute to measuring impact (e.g. paired samples t-tests from datasets imported into Airtable). Please see a draft of the items (in part borrowed from the expansive altruism and effectiveness-focus subscales) at the bottom of the document linked above.&#x20;

<summary>On the statistical tests...</summary>

&#x20;I (David Reinstein) would suggest a Wilcoxon signed-rank test, or a fixed-effects ordered logit if you want this in the context of a model. Or, if you want something that is 'line-of-sight explainable to data scientists' you could do a permutation test.

#### Second  page

On the second page of the voter registration form (optional), students will respond to items that primarily prompt reflection and secondarily might contribute to research on the [proto-EA subscales](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7f3sq7ZHcRsaBBeMD/what-psychological-traits-predict-interest-in-effective) and [speciesism](https://psyarxiv.com/fte9m) in adolescents. Please see a draft of the items in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OLTIQmcgEHpfzel\_qJg5uHNPp3PHLXRMPQwT7\_Sggg0/edit?usp=sharing). In the coming days/weeks I will meet with a lawyer regarding data privacy, etc. on the school agreement form.
