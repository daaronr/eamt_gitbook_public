# Design choices: Protocols, metrics and surveys

## "Voter registration" survey

### Context

{% hint style="info" %}
When is this asked? Is it repeated on the same students from year to year or pre/post to measure impact?
{% endhint %}



### Goals of this survey



> The primary purposes of the subscales would include (a) prompting student reflection on concepts related to effective giving at the beginning of voting week and (b) if it is cleared, contributing to research by Lucius and Matti. The subscales are included on the second page of the [Voter Registration Form (2022 format)](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/FFY5B73).

### Discussion of content

1. On the second page of the voter registration form (optional), students will respond to items that primarily prompt reflection and secondarily might contribute to research on the [proto-EA subscales](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7f3sq7ZHcRsaBBeMD/what-psychological-traits-predict-interest-in-effective) and [speciesism](https://psyarxiv.com/fte9m) in adolescents. Please see a draft of the items in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OLTIQmcgEHpfzel\_qJg5uHNPp3PHLXRMPQwT7\_Sggg0/edit?usp=sharing). In the coming days/weeks I will meet with a lawyer regarding data privacy, etc. on the school agreement form.
2. &#x20;On the first page of the voting ballot (required) and first page of the voter registration form (required), there is room for 3-6 items that prompt student reflection and contribute to measuring impact (e.g. paired samples t-tests from datasets imported into Airtable). Please see a draft of the items (in part borrowed from the expansive altruism and effectiveness-focus subscales) at the bottom of the document linked above. \
