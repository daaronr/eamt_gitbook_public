# FB birthday trial - brief

## Overview&#x20;

Key question: “How does communication about effectiveness (per-dollar impact) influence fundraising for effective charities in a social-media context?” In particular...\


1. Do impact ratings and/or cost-effectiveness motivate individuals to fundraise for effective charities? (And what is the net effect of this on participation and amounts raised?)
2. Do fundraisers (individuals) prefer to use impact measures? Which ones?
3. How do impact measures and metrics within fundraisers perform?\


Field experiment: incentivize birthday Facebook fundraisers &#x20;

* FB ads \~2 weeks before a person’s birthday; “if you start a fundraiser, we’ll donate the first $5” (T\&C) apply
* Links to external page/app asking them to start a fundraiser, with treatments within each of 2-3 arms
  1. "Fundraiser" arm: Vary (non-)presentation of rating and (GiveWell-type) impact information&#x20;
  2. "Message choice" arm: (If we have API access) ask them to choose among a set of messages in different choice sets to be auto-posted on their fundraiser
  3. "Exogenous message": (If API access) we autopost an exogenously-assigned message
* We make the promised $5 donations (with possible messages added to these)

Measured outcomes: 1. do 'people who click the ad' start a fundraising page, 2. How much/many donations do these pages raise?, 3. (if API) Which messages do they choose?, 4. Other messages/discussion on their fundraising page
