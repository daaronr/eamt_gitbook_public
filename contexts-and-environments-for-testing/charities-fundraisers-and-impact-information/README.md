# Charities/fundraisers and impact information



[david reinstein](https://app.gitbook.com/u/WrM9GjKWCyRyoIjCKt7f0ddJwCr1 "mention")research (along with others) considers '_how do potential donors respond to (different presentations of) impact information'. _

{% hint style="info" %}
DR: I'm giving a brief overview and some links here. I want us all to benefit from shared knowledge and tools, but I have some bits I can't share atm, and also I don't want to 'clog up' this resource with 'everything I'm working on. I may flesh this out further as more people become involved.
{% endhint %}

1. We've run large field experiments with** two development charities**: [CRS (in the USA, through DonorVoice)](crs-dv-overview.md), and the[ ICRC (Switzerland)](icrc-quick-overview.md). [Working on writing these up and synthesizing the evidence](https://daaronr.github.io/dualprocess/), also synthesizing this with previously published work (Karlan and Wood (2017), Bergh and Reinstein (2020), perhaps more) in a meta-analysis.
2. &#x20;In a similar vein, I'm working with [Janek Kretschmer](https://app.gitbook.com/u/6WafaQakuhP8Gb7iyAbABpmQQvZ2 "mention"), Paul Smeets, Dean Karlan, and others to put together a '[Facebook fundraising trial](fb-birthday-trial-brief.md)' ... encouraging people to start birthday fundraisers for effective charities. We are planning to test how 'Givewell-style effectiveness ratings' and other presentations, affect this. We also aim to test how willing people are to send these 'impact signals' in this context. I hope to flesh out more details here when I can.
3. &#x20;On a slightly different track, I'm working on an experiment on **JustGiving**, a social fundraising site (UK-based) into 'how do earlier donations on a fundraising page affect later donations and page success' (with an emphasis on 'more effective' charities) This has particular implications for EA donors: should they through  friends' or acquaintances' social fundraisers when these are for effective charities? (An extension of this experiment may  consider 'effectiveness messages left along with donations on these pages).
