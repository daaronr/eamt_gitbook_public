# Charities/fundraisers and impact information

##

[david reinstein](https://app.gitbook.com/u/WrM9GjKWCyRyoIjCKt7f0ddJwCr1 "mention")research (along with others) considers '_how do potential donors respond to (different presentations of) impact information'. _

{% hint style="info" %}
DR: I'm giving a brief overview and some links here. I want us all to benefit from shared knowledge and tools, but I have some bits I can't share atm, and also I don't want to 'clog up' this resource with 'everything I'm working on. I may flesh this out further as more people become involved.
{% endhint %}

We've run large field experiments with two development charities: CRS (in the USA, through DonorVoice), and the ICRC (Switzerland). Working on writing these up and synthesizing the evidence, also synthesizing this with previous published work (Karlan and Wood (2017), Bergh and Reinstein (2020), perhaps more) in a meta-analysis.

In a similar vein, I'm working with [Janek Kretschmer](https://app.gitbook.com/u/6WafaQakuhP8Gb7iyAbABpmQQvZ2 "mention"), Paul Smeets, Dean Karlan, and others to put together a 'Facebook fundraising trial' ... encouraging people to start birthday fundraisers for effective charities. We are planning to test how 'Givewell-style effectiveness ratings' and other presentations, affect this. We also aim to test how willing people are to send these 'impact signals' in this context. I hope to flesh out more details here when I can. &#x20;
