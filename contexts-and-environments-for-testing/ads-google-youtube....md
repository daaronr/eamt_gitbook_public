# Ads \(Google, Youtube...\)

## Notes from conversation with JS Winchell .. needs cleaning

'Drafts and experiments' feature on google/youtube

Measuring for an easy to complete action; an action within the platform, vs a longer term one

'getting people to watch X amount of a video'

'attribution problem'

"ad copy and phrasing on the website" -- the latter is not considered marketing, it is 'communications' but he doesn't have the experience on the latter.

Q: If youtube drives me to the site can I track the actual conversions

We at Youtube sends 100-200 people/day to GWWC

Started EA group at McGill ... people take a v long time to decide whether to take the pledge

This is 'the biggest purchase, but for the rest of your life' ... attribution is difficult.

In the google ds platform you attribute it to a 'lookback window' but lots of changes in privacy ecosystem.

There is a 'click-through' conversions and 'view-through' conversions... the future of the latter is in peril

Once you get someone on the site you can use Google Analytics to see how they got to the site and what they do on the site as long as they go directly' \

Google Analytics uses 'last nondirect click'

### How much does the ad copy and experience and nuance matter

* for search, it's pretty easy
* for videos its much harder

Has a sense of 'what works in videos' -- he has a video that explains a bit about this.

Landing page work ... not sure whom to put us in contact with ... 'UX designer/web dev'

### What is the target ... what is important yet measureable

If you can get someone into an EA group ecosystem you have them as far as you can go

Should GWWC have links to joining uni groups and we can track this?

### Other way to measure impact -- geographic targeting

Look for a lift in particular zip codes/areas

but will the effect be detectable --&gt; empirical

1 cent per person impressions

suggests minimum of 3 'blasts'
