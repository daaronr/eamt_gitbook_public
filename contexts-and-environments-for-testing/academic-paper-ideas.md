# Academic Paper Ideas

The idea behind identifying specific hypotheses is that, if we have some working hypotheses in mind for a paper, it will help:

1. &#x20;Generate ideas for non-profits to test
2. Avoid indecision about what ideas to try
3. Keep those of us with academic publishing incentives motivated

In sum, it's to give us some direction and focus.

Current ideas for papers are summarized in the google doc embedded. The document is divided into:

* one section for each idea we have fleshed out, so far (at oct 23):&#x20;
  * shared community insight framing
  * Donor responses to “quantitative ‘per dollar’ impact information” and presentations of this (DR added)
  * warm glow (DR: 'internal reward) from effectiveness
* a list of others ideas we have yet to flesh out
* some classic ideas we could test (as an alternative to developing novel hypotheses)
