# One For the World

## Interested in

We are particularly interested in:

* activating more donors who took the pledge at university, so that their donations actually start; 
* retaining donors for longer once they activate; 
* upselling donors to give more over time \(either more as a raw amount, e.g. 'keeping pace' at 1% of their income; or more as a percentage, e.g. 'graduating' to take the 10% GWWC pledge\)
* acquiring new donors with fewer touch points, e.g. via online advertising, via our website etc. \(we currently get ~0 organic sign ups\)

## Existing experiments

### NYU - message testing on our homepage

We are working with Joshua Lewis and a group of students at NYU to experiment with messaging on our homepage. A full write-up of this will follow, but essentially we have chosen two new framings for OFTW's message to feature on variations of our homepage, and we're running an A/B test with the [existing homepage](https://www.1fortheworld.org/) as a control. The two messages we are testing are:

1. Identifiable victim:  
   **How to help children like Zawadi**

   Zawadi was malnourished as a baby, but with help from our top charities, is now healthy, happy, and has survived her 5th birthday. If the Zawadi had died, her family would have lost a child they loved, and Zawadi would have lost a lifetime of experiences. Our top charities are among save among the most lives per dollar of any charity. The more donations these charities receive, the more children like Zawadi will survive."

2. Who needs money more?

   **Can you live on 99% of your income?**

   1% of the median US Salary, around $1 a day, probably makes little difference to most people’s wellbeing. However, donating it to effective charities can make a real difference. Our top charities are among the most effective in the world in terms of lives saved per dollar. Instead of spending an extra $1 a day on yourself, learn more about donating to the world’s most effective charities via the One for the World pledge.

We are in the process of creating these homepages and setting up conversion tracking. As OFTW has ~0 organic sign ups currently, we are testing for a variety of conversions, including:

* asking us \(staff\) a question by email
* joining a group call with others wanting to learn about effective donating
* taking the pledge
* making a one-off donation 

### Texas A&M University - activation

We are randomly sending all donors who are due to activate in three months either:

1. a control email saying 'thank you for pledging - look out for emails from us as your approach donation \#1'
2. a treatment email saying 'thank you for pledging -  click here to affirm your pledge; click here to modify your pledge'

Both emails come from Jack as Executive Director. We hope that people who get the treatment email will be more likely to activate.

### Texas A&M University - retention  / upselling

For all donors who are due to reach a donation milestone next month - that is, their 6th, 12th or 24th monthly donation - we are randomly sending them either:

1. a control email saying 'thank you for pledging - 
2. a treatment email saying 'thank you for pledging - do you plan to donate $x again next month, or would you like to update your donation? Click here to keep the current amount / click here to update your donation amount'

Both emails come from Jack as Executive Director. We hope that people who get the treatment email will be more likely to keep donating and/or to increase their donation amount.

## Resources

We are hiring a Communications Officer imminently, who will add more messaging expertise and have a lot more time for this type of work.

We would dearly love to have donors' donation management \(e.g. taking the pledge / updating a pledge etc.\) entirely housed on our own site, both for donor convenience and for analytics purposes. Currently, donors log in at [donational.org](https://donational.org/) to manage their pledges.
