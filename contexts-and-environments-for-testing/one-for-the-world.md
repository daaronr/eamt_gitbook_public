# One For the World \(OftW\)

## Background on OftW

OFTW has a donor base of ~700 active donors, ~1650 pledged donors \(who pledged but haven't started donating yet\) and ~2000 lapsed donors.

80 percent \(of donors?\) are in the USA  

Focus on global health charities

They focus  on donations to GiveWekk charities ... but technically any 510c3



### Typical donor journey: 

We are in the process of creating these homepages and setting up conversion tracking. As OFTW has ~0 organic sign ups currently, we are testing for a variety of conversions, including:

* university campus, someone I like tells me they are involved in oftw, asks me to come along with free food
* at some point I take the pledge
* It is not a highly controlled process
* asking us \(staff\) a question by email
* joining a group call with others wanting to learn about effective donating
* taking the pledge
* making a one-off donation 

### Some rough numbers

650 active donors 1500 people in pipeline not at start date 

750 new people a year are recruited... thinks it would be 2 - 2.5k

OFTW has a donor base of ~700 active donors, ~1650 pledged donors \(who pledged but haven't started donating yet\) and ~2000 lapsed donors.

## Ongoing/completed experiments

### NYU - message testing on our homepage

We are working with Joshua Lewis and a group of students at NYU to experiment with messaging on our homepage. A full write-up of this will follow, but essentially we have chosen two new framings for OFTW's message to feature on variations of our homepage, and we're running an A/B test with the [existing homepage](https://www.1fortheworld.org/) as a control. 

"Exiting home page as of  9 Sep 2021"

The two messages we are testing are:

1. **T1: Identifiable victim: How to help children like Zawadi**
   1. Zawadi was malnourished as a baby, but with help from our top charities, is now healthy, happy, and has survived her 5th birthday. If the Zawadi had died, her family would have lost a child they loved, and Zawadi would have lost a lifetime of experiences. Our top charities are among save among the most lives per dollar of any charity. The more donations these charities receive, the more children like Zawadi will survive."
2. **T2: Who needs money more?**

   **Can you live on 99% of your income?**

   1% of the median US Salary, around $1 a day, probably makes little difference to most people’s wellbeing. However, donating it to effective charities can make a real difference. Our top charities are among the most effective in the world in terms of lives saved per dollar. Instead of spending an extra $1 a day on yourself, learn more about donating to the world’s most effective charities via the One for the World pledge.

### 

### Texas A&M University - activation

We are randomly sending all donors who are due to activate in three months either:

Anchor to a start date 6 months from graduation

1. a control email saying 'thank you for pledging - look out for emails from us as your approach donation \#1'
2. a treatment email saying 'thank you for pledging -  click here to affirm your pledge; click here to modify your pledge'

Over span 4100 took pledge. 1850 left, 1500 pipeliners, 650

Both emails come from Jack as Executive Director. We hope that people who get the treatment email will be more likely to activate.

2400 approx -- pre and post-start cancellations

### Texas A&M University - retention  / upselling

78% of dollars raised have come online

For all donors who are due to reach a donation milestone next month - that is, their 6th, 12th or 24th monthly donation - we are randomly sending them either:

length of time for feedback is a challenge

1. a control email saying 'thank you for pledging - 
2. a treatment email saying 'thank you for pledging - do you plan to donate $x again next month, or would you like to update your donation? Click here to keep the current amount / click here to update your donation amount'

Both emails come from Jack as Executive Director. We hope that people who get the treatment email will be more likely to keep donating and/or to increase their donation amount.

## Other notes

### Reinstein/Lewars conversation notes \(rough\)

* activating more donors who took the pledge at university, so that their donations actually start; 
* retaining donors for longer once they activate; 
* upselling donors to give more over time \(either more as a raw amount, e.g. 'keeping pace' at 1% of their income; or more as a percentage, e.g. 'graduating' to take the 10% GWWC pledge\)
* acquiring new donors with fewer touch points, e.g. via online advertising, via our website etc. \(we currently get ~0 organic sign ups\)

## Resources

We are hiring a Communications Officer imminently, who will add more messaging expertise and have a lot more time for this type of work.

We would dearly love to have donors' donation management \(e.g. taking the pledge / updating a pledge etc.\) entirely housed on our own site, both for donor convenience and for analytics purposes. Currently, donors log in at [donational.org](https://donational.org/) to manage their pledges.
