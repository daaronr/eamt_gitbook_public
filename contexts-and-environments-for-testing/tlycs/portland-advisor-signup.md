****

### Environment/context for trial&#x20;

youtube ads in 1 city, very general population&#x20;

### **Participant universe and sample size**

People living in Portland Oregon in the top 10% of household income (approximated by Google) will get an in-stream ad (ad plays before the video that the user intended to watch)

* Who will be targeted or who do you expect to be part of the trial?
* How many people (or 'units') do you expect to be involved (median guess)?
* (Optional): How many do you expect will have a 'positive outcome'?

### Key treatment(s)

Ten versions of youtube ad video ...&#x20;

LINK to these?

Three main videos

1. funny cartoon song
2. person speaking to camera
3. giving away money to poor people and see their response (!connecting with someone)



### Treatment assignment procedure

Using YT/GG optimize algorithm (share specific details and parameters please)

* Varied at what level (individual visitors, postal codes, days of the week, etc)
* How are treatments assigned ('blocked randomization', 'adaptive/Thomson sampling', etc.)
* How many/what share are assigned to each treatment?

***

### **Outcome data**

* How long they watch
* Whether they click through
* **Whether they fill out the form (Algorithm is serving to optimize this)**

&#x20;

* What will be collected, when and how
* Where will the data be stored, who will have access

### **Optional/suggested additions**

Planned analysis methods, preregistration link, IRB link, connection to other projects and promotions
