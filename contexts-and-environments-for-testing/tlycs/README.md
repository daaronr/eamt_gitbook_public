# TLYCS

## [The Life You Can Save ](https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/)

Leads: Bilal Siddiqi, Neela Saldhana;  
Other partner contact: Jon Behar \(Giving Games\)

## Proposed trials and tests, initiatives, and plans

### **Bespoke recommendations and funds**

TLYCS is considering introducing cause-area funds to allow people with specific cause and beneficiary preferences to nonetheless have effective giving options.  They are also considering tools for helping elicit these preferences and guide people. 

_Issues/questions:_ 

* Will cause-specific funds increase overall giving? \(If not it may be a negative, as it could decrease overall efficiency\)
  * How to best present and describe cause-specific funds? Which causes?
* Will asking people about their preferences increase \(or decrease\) giving? Why or why not?
  * Makes them feel more cared about \(+\)
  * Tailoring, better donor optimization to own preferences \(+\)
  * Opportunity for expressive giving, even if automated \(+\)
  * More forms to fill out --&gt; more time and cognitive cost \(-\)
  * "Automated questions" \(& bots\) --&gt; feeling personally neglected, less expressive \(-\)
  * Uncertainty about preferences --&gt; inaction \(-\)

_We outline a proposed_ [_Funds Recommendations trial i_](funds-recommendations-trial.md)_n the subchapter_ [_\(linked\)_](funds-recommendations-trial.md)\_\_

### _"Start-up impact initiatives ... incubation granting' ..._ 

relates to charity entrepreneurs and DPrize



## Other notes

* Target "Giving Season" timing-wise
* What would be actionable?
* How do people come into this funnel?
  * Searching for most good in the abstract, then this is easy?
  * If somebody already has something in mind… 
    * Good to match the donations to a location people are interested in
    * We want to match our offering to the cause people are interested in 
* Neela and Bilal were keen on targeting particularly in Australia...
* Logistics: 
  1. Barriers: basically hard to change website cos of team / technical barriers
  2. We were discussing funding 
  3. But seems that advertising to get people to website is best… and there are funds
* "Obligation vs. supererogatory" \(Neela\)
  * Drowning child vs. burning building \[EXPLAIN\]
* [Profiling](../../profiling-and-segmentation/profiling-discussion.md)
  * TLYCS are a little bit older / more female than Givewell/GWWC
  * Who is most likely to donate overseas? People who travel…
  * Neela mentioned ["Behavioral Insights To End Global Poverty" \(Princeton report for TLYCS, Jan 2021\)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xggx5gz4k0219gt/SPI%20591b%20-%20Behavioral%20Insights%20To%20End%20Global%20Poverty%20-%20Jan%202021.pdf?dl=0)

## **What is TLYCS already doing/contemplating doing**

* what are the parameters/messages we can play with
* what is tracked, what are the desired outcomes



### What resources can we access \($$ for ads\)?

Free GoogleAds thing -- maybe not being used? -- JS Winchell knows the most about this.

## **Social media trials**

FB targeted ads 

* split randomly \(or by an untraceable block\) and use cookies/trackbacks
* split geographically \(trace outcomes within a geographic region\) 

\(Contact Will Bullock \(sp?\) at FB\) 

A solicitation to... 

* A TLYCS -organized fundraiser... 
  * A fundraiser _within_ Facebook, easier to track
    * [\(see HERE for FB help including tracking\)](https://www.facebook.com/help/1787615158233986)
  * "Fundraiser API" meant to help with this 

## **\(Suggested\) fortnightly meeting**

Currently every other Wednesday 1pm.

> _Modelling the project around the Princeton report seems like it could work and will seem more organic_

DR: takeaways \(from summary... the Author's takes _except where italicized_\)

* 5 key principles: choice architecture, social norms, empathy, overhead cost aversion, and anchoring

Factual:

* TLYCS demographics are predictable \(White, Male, tech...\)
* Donations cluster at end of tax year 

Pages and promotion

*  Social media channel is promising?
* "Best charities" page underperforms -- high bounce.
  * _DR: Maybe because Givewell etc do better at this?_
* "Visual presentation of charities does have an effect
  * _DR: Not clear how this is causally identified_
* Ran "social media tests' they claim are underpowered. 
  * _DR:_ but these can be analyzed with Bayesian methods for actionable insights
* suggest simplified presentation/navigation, 'decision tree quiz' to reduce cognitive load

_Bilal agrees that this could be a good jumping-off point for suggesting trials_

#### Other work 

Bilal suggested reading this special issue: 

{% embed url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-behavioral-and-experimental-economics/vol/66/suppl/C" %}

{% hint style="info" %}
David Reinstein: The Karlan and Wood paper is particularly relevant. I see that as the first -- albeit limited and contextual -  evidence on how donors react to quantitative/scientific impact information.  My notes on this paper are [HERE](https://daaronr.github.io/ea_giving_barriers/eval-aversion.html#analytical-grinch) \(I should incorporate these into the present wiki to enable discussion and expansion\)  
  
Other papers in that issue \(some in lab settings\) also appear relevant, especially:  
- [Do people donate more when they perceive a single beneficiary whom they know? A field experimental test of the identifiability effect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214804316300179)  
[- Information and donations to development aid projects](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214804316300295) \(Lab giving to charities\)   
- Maybe:  [Nudging charitable giving: Three field experiments](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214804316300222)  
  
_But note that some of these papers are from 'Big Economists' who normally would see "getting a paper in a JBEE special issue" as a non-success. So each paper probably has important limitations._

Bilal also talked about this intervention which involved video messages by one of the authors: ["Messages on Covid Prevention in India..."](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w27496/w27496.pdf) \(NBER\)
