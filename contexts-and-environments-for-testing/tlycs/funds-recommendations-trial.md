# Funds/recommendations trial

## Proposed trial design ('conceptual 2x2')

1. No Questions dimension
   * CONTROL: 25-30 charities to choose from or Single fund ... 90-10 fund \[possibly consider testing emphasis]
   * BUNDLES: 25-30 to choose + Four bundled cause-area groups (Cause areas: Climate, Poverty,..) + 90/10 ...
2. Questions dimension ('what are you interested in'? etc)
   * RECOMMEND: Get 5 bespoke charities recommended and the 90-10 fund
   * BESPOKE FUND: 1 bespoke fund + 90-10 only
   * (Could give bespoke funds and bespoke charities ... but probably leave this out)

ALTERNATIVE tests and concerns: compare sales funnel or open-response interaction to help get people into different areas/interest ... a completely automated "DAO" as the ultimate product

* Q: Will this do worse relative to human interaction? To what extent will recommending or pushing the bot make people feel less listened-to?

Should they give options  ... a  'foot in the door' option?
