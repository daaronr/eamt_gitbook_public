# Funds/recommendations trial

## Proposed trial design \('conceptual 2x2'\)

1. No Questions dimension
   *  CONTROL: 25-30 charities to choose from or Single fund ... 90-10 fund \[possibly consider testing  emphasis\]
   * BUNDLES: 25-30 to choose + Four bundled cause-area groups \(Cause areas: Climate, Poverty,..\)   + 90/10 ...
2. QUESTIONS dimension \('what are you interested in'? etc\)
   * RECOMMEND: Get 5 bespoke charities recommended and the 90-10 fund
   * BESPOKE FUND: 1 bespoke fund + 90-10 only
   * \(Could give bespoke funds and bespoke charities ... but probably leave this out\) 

ALTERNATIVE tests and concerns: compare sales funnel or open-response interaction to help get people into different areas/interest ... a completely automated "DAO" as the ultimate product

* Q: vs human interaction? to what extent do we recommend the bot or not?
