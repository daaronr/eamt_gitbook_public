# Advisor signup (Portland)

Filling out using [trial-reporting-template.md](../trial-reporting-template.md "mention") format

(Reinstein working with JS Winchell, incorporating [his notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eIt4cXfNqIHr2HiGcb8Mf06BOqR2Pgcga8In-VcLTPA/edit))

### **General idea, main 'hypothesis' (if there is one)**

_Specific goal of promotion:_ Get people to fill out [a form](https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/advisor/) to request an appointment with a donation advisor while simultaneously raising awareness for TLYCS

* Can we get people to sign up for donation advice using existing videos in YouTube Ads?
  * How many sign up and what sorts of people &#x20;
* Which ads are best at this? (These ads differ in substance as well as in style)&#x20;

### Point of contact (at organization running trial)\*

Chantal Johnson - TLYCS&#x20;

End date: December 31 (planned)

### Environment/context for trial&#x20;

YouTube Ads

### **Participant universe and sample size**

Location: Portland, OR&#x20;

Audience: Top 10% household income

People living in Portland Oregon in the top 10% of household income (approximated by Google) will get an in-stream ad (ad plays before the video that the user intended to watch)

### Key treatment(s)

Exposure to a sequence of ten versions of youtube ad videos

Frequency cap: 6/week ...&#x20;



Three main 'theme/header' variations (but these seem similar?)

Three categories of videos within each ("Bravery/$10/I want to do good")&#x20;

1. funny cartoon song
2. person speaking to camera
3. giving away money to poor people and see their response (!connecting with someone)

### Treatment assignment procedure

Using YT/GG optimize algorithm (share specific details and parameters please)

* Varied at what level (individual visitors, postal codes, days of the week, etc)
* How are treatments assigned ('blocked randomization', 'adaptive/Thomson sampling', etc.)
* How many/what share are assigned to each treatment?

***

### **Outcome data**

* How long they watch
* Whether they click through
* **Whether they fill out the form (Algorithm is serving to optimize this)**

&#x20;

* What will be collected, when and how
* Where will the data be stored, who will have access

### **Optional/suggested additions**

Planned analysis methods, preregistration link, IRB link, connection to other projects and promotions
