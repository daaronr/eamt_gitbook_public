# Advisor signup (Portland) (+)

{% hint style="info" %}
Filling out using [trial-reporting-template](../../trial-reporting-template/ "mention") format

(Reinstein working with JS Winchell, incorporating [his notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eIt4cXfNqIHr2HiGcb8Mf06BOqR2Pgcga8In-VcLTPA/edit))
{% endhint %}

### **General idea, main 'hypothesis' (if there is one)**

_Specific goal of promotion:_ Get people to click in the ad go to the 'landing page' fill out [a form](https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/advisor/) to request an appointment with a donation advisor while simultaneously raising awareness for TLYCS

1. Can we get people to sign up for donation advice using videos in YouTube Ads?
   * How many sign-up and what sorts of people?
2. Do these ads boost engagement with TLYCS in net? (E.g. donations, website activity, book downloads)
   * "Lift test" on Portland market (analyze with difference-in-difference relative to other markets)
3. Which ads are best at this? (These ads differ in substance as well as in style)

### Point of contact (at organization running trial)\*

Stacey Black - TLYCS

Chantal Johnson - TLYCS

Johnstuart Winchell - Google/YouTube (j.s.winchell@gmail.com)

### Timing of trial (when will it/did it start/end, if known)

Launch date: December 3

End date: December 31&#x20;

### Digital location where project 'lives' (planning, material, data)

Nothing has been organized yet. This interface is the best summary atm. Google/YouTube Ads interface will have the data.(Email conversations with JS and TLYCS has some content)

_Update: other data is on TLYCS Google Analytics_

### Environment/context for trial

YouTube Ads

### **Participant universe and sample size**

Location: Portland, OR

Audience: Top 10% household income

People living in Portland, Oregon in the top 10% of household income (approximated by Google) will get an in-stream ad (ad plays before video user intended to watch)

### Key treatment(s)

Exposure to a sequence of nine versions of YouTube ad videos. Frequency cap: 6/weeks&#x20;

**Three main 'theme/header' variations (similar, slightly different phrasings)**

_interacted with..._

**Three categories of videos** within each theme:

1. "**Bravery**": Charlie Bresler explaining to camera how 'you can save lives like Superman without being brave like him ... with small amounts of money for bednets, nutrient micro-doses, etc.
2. **$10:** African (looking) guy giving out money (up to $10) to (poor?) people in Capetown who are very happy and grateful (they speak an African language (?), some subtitles). Text narrative overlaid about how $5 can buy a slice of pizza or an interocular lens to treat cataracts, etc. Emotional, a bit towards 'identified victims/recipients'
3. **"I want to do good":** Colorful puppets (with some cartoons) sing (British accents) about how good it feels to give up things they don't need and to donate to save lives, and counter common arguments about this 'breeding dependency', fear of administrative waste, etc.

{% hint style="info" %}
The videos I could see didn't actually link the 'advisor landing page' in the video or on the bottom. Looking at your notes, I guess (?) these come in pop-up things in the 'real context' on Youtube, e.g., as in...

{% endhint %}

These are organized and linked [**here**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NIXQNZH8O8XajXBpKocpbZ1yT3hblIv8E0vMfNg1J14/edit?pli=1)**.**

Each video comes with the (same?) sitelink extension with a Call to Action:

### Treatment assignment procedure

Uses a YouTube/Google optimization algorithm.

Optimizing for: Advisor form fills (maximizing the probability that a user fills out the linked form)

DR: Presumably  targets videos initially by random draw, and then serves videos more that performed better, perhaps interacting this learning with user demography etc.

### **Outcome data**

* How long they watch
* Whether they click through
* **Whether they fill out the form (Algorithm is serving to optimize this)**
* What will be collected, when and how
* Where will the data be stored, who will have access

### **Optional/suggested additions**

Planned analysis methods, preregistration link, IRB link, connection to other projects and promotions
