# Results (first-pass)

DR: I took a quick look through Google Analytics on this. I saved a data snapshot [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lquhw7a2jq8s3pz/portland%20vs%20comparison%20citiesAnalytics%20TLYCS%20-%20all%20domains%20portland%20another%20try%2020211203-20220102%2020201203-20210102.xlsx?dl=0) (see 'dataset 1),  shared only with JS. I hope this is OK. A few quick results:

1. There are very few signups for concierge advising service. Only about 16 in December 2021 globally, only 1 of which was from Portland
2. Eyeballing it, while the number of sessions is higher for the Dec 2021 period than for the Dec 2020 period, this increase is pretty common across cities, Portland doesn’t seem to be an exception.
3. If it’s important I could try to quantify ‘statistical  bounds on the maximum size of the size of the impact of this promotion on site traffic from Portland’ … but I doubt this is worth doing
4. Google Analytics is a bit annoying; do you know if there is a way to ‘just get the raw data’?
