# Charity Elections

Charity Elections is working with [gwwc](gwwc/ "mention") to run programs in high schools involving learning about and doing effective charitable giving&#x20;

## Information from Greg, 3/5/22

Hi EAMT team,

Thanks for the orientation last week! I wanted to make a quick post in the gitbook to (a) provide more information about the program and (b) share information about how the program has been evaluated previously. Please see the information under the subheadings below.

### Program Overview

The following links provide an overview of the program.

### Thoughts on Measuring Impact

In correspondence with EA Funds, we were asked to respond to the question, Can you be more concrete about how Charity Elections generates impact, and how you plan on measuring this in 2022? Please see our response to that question pasted below. After checking in with Luke, he mentioned the possibility of doing (v) with a closed-ended question instead of the open-ended question, If you were given $100 to donate to charity, how would you decide where to donate? Some of the factors do not serve to measure impact from the standpoint of effective giving but do serve to provide teachers with data that is relevant to schools, as exemplified in the short video linked above.\
\
All participating students are provided an EA framework for understanding charity effectiveness, and students implementing the flagship program (voting ballots, 'I Voted' stickers, etc.) are also provided an EA framework for understanding cause prioritisation. Giving What We Can suggested the rough target of increasing the reach of the program from six schools and 2,000 students in 2021 to 15-40 schools and 10,000+ students in 2022.\
\
Given the variety of outcomes that are relevant to effective altruism as well as the participatory role that students and teachers hold in the process, the framework that has been used to measure impact has been Comprehensive Mixed-Methods Participatory Evaluation (CMMPE). The six basic assumptions of that framework are as follows: "program success is dynamic and multi-dimensional; definitions and perspectives of program success are likely to vary among stakeholders; program evaluation has multiple purposes; comprehensive program evaluation requires mixed qualitative-quantitative methods; comprehensive program evaluation requires participation of stakeholders; and comprehensive program evaluation requires advanced planning and is integral to service delivery" (Nastasi & Hitchcock, 2008).\
\
As a graduate student in School Psychology, I believe the program not only generates impact from the standpoint of directly increasing the number of young people who are exposed to principles of effective altruism, but as noted in the assumptions of CMMPE may also be valuable to other stakeholders. For social studies teachers, the event promotes youth voice and civic engagement and inspires critical and creative thinking; for school psychologists and school administrators, the event promotes compassion and positive school climate; for student leaders, the event offers a unique service leadership opportunity, training in effective altruism, and experience for college applications; and for effective altruists, the event serves to introduce a large number of high schoolers to principles of effective altruism in a way that is consistent with their development as young people and learners, deeply honoring their voice in the research, discussion and voting process, and can be used to forge sustained connections between talented young people and EA. Since the event offers benefits to stakeholders in educational communities as well as the EA community, the event can attract students and teachers who do not have prior experience with effective altruism and might be introduced to its principles through a Charity Election.\
\
Here is a list of some of the key outcomes measured:\
**(i)** Number of students/teachers trained in EA frameworks (e.g. [cause prioritisation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JUx6fL7-ngC9C7Gl1mIO053GRUba8Qtb/view), [charity effectiveness](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18tosVcNymYZfArfd0Q7offgyu1IUHNL6/view?usp=sharing))\
\
**(ii)** Number of student leaders running the program and earning [Service Leadership Certificates](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Bdqcp960vTELuiSV6j\_lwCquWgNi00US/view?usp=sharing) (e.g. 28 student leaders in 2021)\
\
**(iii)** Work produced by students and teachers (e.g. [articles](https://balcattashs.wa.edu.au/charity-election/), [Instagram pages](https://www.instagram.com/explocharityevent/), [student clubs](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lA20PRV9FOvdGDXXcb\_43SkLcVuKy7Me/view), community fundraising)\
\
**(iv)** Testimonials from students and teachers (e.g. student testimonials on the [webpage](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/events/guides/charity-elections/) and a few teacher testimonials below)\
"Pupils at The Perse School in Cambridgeshire thoroughly enjoyed being involved with Giving What We Can’s Charity Elections. The sixth form Charities Committee decided to divide up into three teams to research the charities and do a short pitch to convince pupils to vote for their selected charity. This was such a valuable exercise for the pupils who perhaps hadn’t thought about why you might choose one charity over another and it allowed in-depth discussion of how important cost-effectiveness is and how you might measure impact. Inclusion of The Humane League as an option to be selected also prompted a discussion surrounding the idea of expanding our moral circle and how much importance we place on animal suffering. Feedback from pupils in the rest of the school was very positive, and they appreciated being asked directly about their views."\
\
"I think the charity election was a phenomenal success / experience for our kids and I'm even hoping to take part again next year if it's an option! I think it was an incredible way to very straightforwardly introduce the concept of EA and in a context that made the underlying theme of measuring impact that much more clear since students actually got to vote on what would be most impactful for them."\
\
“I was impressed with the Northfield High School charity election conducted in our Social Studies classes this past December. Students and teachers were given a great opportunity to discuss personal responsibility about worldwide issues. Researching a charity and casting a vote that includes actual funds to the winning charity gave students a chance to truly practice what it means to be ‘global citizens.’” - Kevin Dahle, Civics teacher, former Minnesota state senator, Minnesota Alliance With Youth board member\
\
**(v)** Differences in attitudes to charitable giving between pre-event survey and post-event survey\
The relative importance of the six considerations below were measured by The Life You Can Save:\
\- Having a high positive impact per dollar donated **(increase in relative importance)**\
****- Supported by evidence on the effectiveness of its work **(increase in relative importance)**\
****- Tackling one of the world's most critical problems\
\- Spending the majority of its funds on the cause, not its own running costs\
\- Helping people in my \[particular] community **(decrease in relative importance)**\
****- Working on an issue I have a personal connection to\
\
**(vi)** Differences in rated importance of student values\
At both schools implementing a comprehensive event with \~700 students and pre/post surveys in 2021, students showed an increase in all four measured outcomes below:\
\- Being compassionate is important to me\
\- Thinking critically is important to me\
\- Thinking creatively is important to me\
\- Making the world a better place is important to me\
\
**(vii)** Percentage of students indicating agreement with statements about the event\
For example, at three of the six schools in 2021, 100% of participating students indicated they voted for a cause they believe in. At the remaining three schools, 98%, 97%, and 95% of students indicated they voted for a cause they believe in. Students consistently indicated they “thought critically about what makes a charity effective” and “felt a sense of purpose or meaning.”\
\
**(viii)** Number of email subscriptions to EA-related organisations\
In 2019, there were hundreds of email subscriptions made to The Life You Can Save and One for the World at a rate of approximately two subscriptions per five participating students. Through partnership with Lucius Caviola several schools have been provided a special matching code with Giving Multiplier, and we also provided schools with Giving What We Can's [Effective](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/giving-guide/)[ Giving Guide](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/giving-guide/).\
\
**(ix)** Interviews from student leaders (e.g. [report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13avkJoQGNt\_omXxEebe-7RICl4\_KVeMe/view?usp=sharing) from the AP Government class at Northfield High School)\
After running a Charity Election, student leaders have conducted interviews with 50+ students and shared their findings with Giving What We Can. Here are sample interview questions written by student leaders in an IB Philosophy class:\
\- What do you think about the Charity Elections week? Did you learn anything new?\
\- Which do you think was the most important part in the Charity Elections (the presentations, the voting itself, the discussion, etc.)?\
\- Have the elections brought about any change in your attitude towards making donations? Why/why not?\
\- Had you donated before? If the answer is “yes”, how was this experience different?\
\- Would you like to take part in more activities like this one in the future? How and why?\
\
**(x)** Ongoing engagement\
In 2022, we also intend to develop a mechanism by which we can track the most promising students in the medium- and long-term to gauge lasting counterfactual impact in terms of engagement with EA or involvement in EA-aligned activities.\
\
**(xi)** University mentorship\
In 2022, we might also measure impact by gathering feedback from university EA groups supporting high schoolers in setting up an ongoing EA club.
