# Trial reporting template

_**For each proposed/ongoing/past trial, we should report the following minimal details, with links (proposed template)**_

(**... **and 'academic lead' if there is one)



### Timing of trial (when will it/did it start and end, if known)&#x20;



### Digital location where project 'lives' (planning, material, data)

The present Gitbook/and a nested Github repo folder could be ideal. Please give a precise link



### Environment/context for trial&#x20;

(web page, advertisement, etc)



### **Participant universe and sample size**

* Who will be targeted or who do you expect to be part of the trial?

### Treatment assignment procedure&#x20;

* Varied at what level (individual visitors, postal codes, days of the week, etc)
* How are treatments assigned ('blocked randomization', 'adaptive/Thomson sampling', etc.)
