# Trial reporting template

_**For each proposed/ongoing/past trial, we should report the following minimal details, with links (proposed template)**_

**If you don't have time and you have another clear presentation of most of this, please link or embed it.**



## "Concise reporting template"

{% hint style="info" %}
Please keep your answers brief -- if you want to give more detail (which is not necessary) please link a later section or external page. \_
{% endhint %}

### **General idea, main 'hypothesis' (if there is one)**

(Optional: brief on background theory and previous evidence)

### Point of contact (at organization running trial)\*

\*and 'academic lead' if there is one

### Timing of trial (when will it/did it start and end, if known)

### Digital location where project 'lives' (planning, material, data)

The present Gitbook/and a nested Github repo folder could be ideal. Please give a precise link

### Environment/context for trial

(web page, advertisement, etc)

### **Participant universe and sample size**

* Who will be targeted or who do you expect to be part of the trial?
* How many people (or 'units') do you expect to be involved (median guess)?
* (Optional): How many do you expect will have a 'positive outcome'?

### Key treatment(s)

Description, link exact language/content if possible

### Treatment assignment procedure

* Varied at what level (individual visitors, postal codes, days of the week, etc)
* How are treatments assigned ('blocked randomization', 'adaptive/Thomson sampling', etc.)
* How many/what share are assigned to each treatment?

***

### **Outcome data**

* What will be collected, when and how
* Where will the data be stored, who will have access

### **Optional/suggested additions**

Planned analysis methods, preregistration link, IRB link, connection to other projects and promotions



## Ex-post: Reporting results (brief)

### Implementation and data collection

1. Did it go as planned? Any departures? (Timing, randomization, design changes, etc)
2. How much/what data was collected? How many observations?
3. Where is the data stored (also link/adjust the above), who has it, and under what conditions?

### Basic results/outcomes&#x20;

1. "Partners and stakeholders opinions": were they happy with the trial? Did they seem to think it was a success?
2. Simplest statement (e.g., "3% donated in the treatment versus 2.2% in the control, with an average amount raised of $4.3 in the treatment and $3.1 in the control')
3. Preliminary interpretation, with statistical test if possible (e.g., 'google Optimize states an 80% chance that the treatment outperformed the control', a Fisher's exact test yields a p=0.06 that a positive donations was more likely in the treatment than the control)
4. "Full analysis"
   1. Who/what when will it be done?
   2. Link to 'where' it will be done (both the 'follow up the pre-analysis plan, and the full write-up, if applicable)
   3. Possibly: Briefly characterize the overall confusions/state of analysis here (state the date last updated)&#x20;
