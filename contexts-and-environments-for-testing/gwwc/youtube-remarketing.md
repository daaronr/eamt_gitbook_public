# YouTube Remarketing

JS: I wanted to let you know that GWWC just launched a YouTube remarketing campaign. That means that when someone goes to the GWWC website, leaves, and then goes to YouTube we show them one of the following videos:

* [Example 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYeDfRx8U7k&t=12s)
* [Example 2](https://www.youtube.com/c/GivingWhatWeCanCommunity/videos)
* [Example 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdo8m7aVB6I)
* [Example 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vL2TuygAfg&t=319s)
* [Example 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4T-q1vAgzE)
* [Example 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41tlWqyD094&t=92s)
* [Example 7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiG_NrxIEns&t=636s)

## Understanding assignment, proposing experimental design [@Joshua Lewis](https://givingexperiments.slack.com/team/U01UF8NJEAX)â€™s questions:

> Is each video assigned to a different situation or are videos randomly chosen to be displayed? If the latter, you could randomize videos by location and see if the different videos were more or less effective. Alternatively, just randomizing the whole campaign seems like a good idea to me....

[JS Winchell](https://app.slack.com/team/U028K7WG49H):  

> videos are selected based on the likelihood of the user watching &gt;30 seconds \(by the algorithm\)
>
> \[DR: Can you elaborate on this? Is there a random/balanced element or is each user deterministically assigned to a video based on his demography, cookies, etc?\]  
> ...  
> randomization by individual will be hard  because users don't click and act right away. instead I think we have to randomize by geography
>
> ...

## Proposed next steps

> Here are what I see as next steps:  _\[DR: next steps for remarketing trial?\]_
>
> 1. Researchers assign the Designated Marketing Areas for test/control _\[DR: can you elaborate which/what the "DMA"s are?\]_
> 2. I can use those DMAs to size how much money we need for the campaign
> 3. Apply for funding somewhere \(if you don't already have the money\)
> 4. I set up and launch the campaign
