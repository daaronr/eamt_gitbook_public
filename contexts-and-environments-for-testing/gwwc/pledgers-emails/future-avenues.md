**Targeting**

If the aim is to change the culture of giving generally, what kind of people should we be targeting?

1.       People with lots of social influence

2.       Low hanging fruit \(i.e., people who are naturally predisposed towards these ideas\)

One interesting thing to do would be to try different methods of outreach and compare them on a basis of cost per whatever-metric-we-use.

Methods I have been thinking about include targeting based on:  

-          Public lists of political donations \(e.g, archive.org\)

o   Could target donors who donated to candidates sympathetic to a relevant cause area

-          Internet activity

o   Watching videos relevant to a cause area

o   Reddit threads relative to a cause area

o   Reading magazines / news websites relevant to a cause area

o   Searching or going on webpages for, say, Charity Navigator

-          Education

o   Enrollment on a degree relevant to a cause area

o   People at institutions which are likely to give them more influence

-          Exploiting social network structure

o   Targeting on basis of number of followers / friends / etc..

-          Searching for specific terms on search engines

-          Podcasts people listen to \(e.g., podcasts about philanthropy or economics\)

**Other, scalable contexts in which to test outreach messaging**

Platforms that easily facilitate randomization:

-          Email lists \(subject headings with DV as open rates might work\)

-          Facebook \(but you can’t stop it targeting different message to different populations\)

Platforms that should facilitate randomization by geography \(for ease of attribution… so long as you can tell the zip codes of people who sign up to email lists etc.\) or perhaps would randomize different versions of adverts and allow you to measure click rates – but that I don’t have experience with.

-          Online display advertising

-          Googlesearch

-          YouTube

-          LinkedIn

**How to test rich content?**

-          Emails might be an opportunity

-          Surveys with professional participants

-          Surveys with undergraduates

Not sure if you can generalize from convenience samples – might be good to think of creative ways of doing that though, e.g., looking at which content creates the most extreme enthusiasm.  

**What to test in rich content?**

-          Does messenger matter?

-          Does messenger demographics and appearance matter?

-          Does it depend on audience?

-          What’s the optimal length?

**Message customization**

We haven’t thought about this much but it seems important – it might be worth, for example, having different messaging for different cause areas and letting them be algorithmically targeted. 

**Imagery / non-content considerations**

-          How many images to include on a page?

-          How much text to include in a page?

-          How many buttons?

-          How many choice options?
