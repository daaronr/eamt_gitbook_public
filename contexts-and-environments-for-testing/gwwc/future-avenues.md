# Future Avenues

## **Targeting**

_See also_ [_Profiling: Discussion_](../../profiling-and-segmentation/profiling-discussion.md)

**Question:** If our aim is _to change the culture of giving in general_, what kind of people should we be targeting?

1. People with lots of social influence
2. Low-hanging fruit \(i.e., people who are naturally predisposed towards effective giving, pledging, and EA\)

{% hint style="success" %}
**Idea:** Compare different outreach methods on the basis of "cost per pledge" \(or per "whatever-metric-we-use"\). \(Outcomes: [Outcome: Effective gift](../../proposed-tools-for-motivating-effective-giving/oc-effective-donation-consider-effectiveness/)... & [Outcome: Pledge](../../proposed-tools-for-motivating-effective-giving/moral-duty-of-well-off/)... \)
{% endhint %}

Compare _different outreach methods_ on the basis of "cost per pledge" \(or per "whatever-metric-we-use"\). \(See [Outcome: Effective gift.](../../proposed-tools-for-motivating-effective-giving/oc-effective-donation-consider-effectiveness/).. and [Outcome: Pledge..](../../proposed-tools-for-motivating-effective-giving/moral-duty-of-well-off/). discussions.\)

### Ideas/methods for targeting: platforms and audiences

* Public lists of political donations \(e.g, [archive.org](https://github.com/daaronr/effective_giving_market_testing/tree/6930982530446fb3eca07600975697123b09c7da/contexts-and-environments-for-testing/gwwc/www.archive.org)\)
  * ... donors to candidates sympathetic to a relevant cause area
* Internet activity ... those who watch/read/search for:
  * Videos relevant to a cause area
  * Reddit threads relevant to a cause area
  * Magazines/news sites relevant to a cause area
  * Search/visiting webpages about charity effectiveness/merit \(e.g., Charity Navigator\) üëç 
* Education
  * Courses/degrees/majors relevant to a cause area 
    * \(e.g., development econ/studies, animal behavior, AI\)
  * People at high-status institutions \(future influencers/policymakers\)
* Exploiting social network structure
  * Targeting "influencers" and "central" people \(on the basis of "number of followers" / friends / etc.\)
* Key search terms \(google 'effective giving' etc\)
* Podcasts listeners \(philanthropy, economics, development & global health ...\)

## Other, scalable contexts in which to test outreach messaging

### Platforms enabling individual randomization & tracking 

* Email lists \(subject headers w/ 'open rates' as dependent variable\)
* Facebook 
  * But the targeting algorithm may frustrate randomization

### Platforms that facilitate [randomization by geograph](../../methodological-discussion/implementation-and-collecting-data-issues/geographic-segmentation-blocked-randomization.md)[y](../../methodological-discussion/implementation-and-collecting-data-issues/geographic-segmentation-blocked-randomization.md) 

This is helpful [for ease of attribution](../../methodological-discussion/implementation-and-collecting-data-issues/geographic-segmentation-blocked-randomization.md) if the **important outcomes** can be tracked by zip code/address. 

* Online display advertising
* Google search
* YouTube
* LinkedIn

## Testing Rich Content

Luke mentioned it would be a high priority to test the effectiveness of "rich content", i.e., short or even long talks, book chapters, podcasts, and so forth. It might be something paid participants are more useful for as we can get richer feedback too.  

### How to test rich content?

* Emails might be an opportunity
* Surveys with professional participants
* Surveys with undergraduates

Not sure if you can generalize from convenience samples ‚Äì might be good to think of creative ways of doing that though, e.g., looking at which content creates the most extreme enthusiasm.

### What to test in rich content?

* Does messenger matter?
* Does messenger demographics and appearance matter?
* Does it depend on audience?
* What‚Äôs the optimal length?

### Message customization

We haven‚Äôt thought about this much but it seems important ‚Äì it might be worth, for example, having different messaging for different cause areas and letting them be algorithmically targeted.

## Imagery / non-content considerations

* How many images to include on a page?
* How much text to include in a page?
* How many buttons?
* How many choice options?
