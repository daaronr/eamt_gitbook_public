# Testing Contexts and Strategies for Prioritization

## **What to test: simple messaging and themes**

Link content here ... but we are considering _strategies_ on this page, so we don't go into detail.

## Scalable contexts/platforms: to test outreach messaging

### ... enabling individual randomization & tracking of medium-term outcomes 

* GWWC web site _at point of email signup_
* Email lists 
  * immediate: subject headers w/ 'open rates' as dependent variable
  * medium-term: all outcomes tied to email

### ... immediate outcomes \(clicks etc\)

Facebook 

* But the targeting algorithm may frustrate randomization. Can it be switched off?

### ... facilitate [randomization by geograph](../../methodological-discussion/implementation-and-collecting-data-issues/geographic-segmentation-blocked-randomization.md)[y](../../methodological-discussion/implementation-and-collecting-data-issues/geographic-segmentation-blocked-randomization.md) 

This is helpful [for ease of attribution](../../methodological-discussion/implementation-and-collecting-data-issues/geographic-segmentation-blocked-randomization.md) if the **important outcomes** can be tracked by zip code/address. 

* Online display advertising
* Google search
* YouTube
* LinkedIn
* Facebook \(presumably\)

## Testing Rich Content

\(explain why this is a priority and what it is\)

### How to test rich content?

We can use some of the same strategies as above to test  "rich content", i.e., short or even long talks, book chapters, podcasts, and so forth. 

However, we may also want richer more detailed 'qualitative' feedback.. Paid participants may allow  richer feedback.  

* Emails might be an opportunity
* Surveys with professional participants
* Surveys with undergraduates

Not sure if you can generalize from convenience samples ‚Äì might be good to think of creative ways of doing that though, e.g., looking at which content creates the most extreme enthusiasm.

### What to test in rich content?

* Does messenger matter?
* Does messenger demographics and appearance matter?
* Does it depend on audience?
* What‚Äôs the optimal length?

## Message customization \(heterogeneity and targeted marketing\)

We haven‚Äôt thought about this much but it seems important ‚Äì it might be worth, for example, having different messaging for different cause areas and letting them be algorithmically targeted.

## Imagery / non-content considerations

* How many images to include on a page?
* How much text to include in a page?
* How many buttons?
* How many choice options?

The 'mysterious sauce' ... JS knows about ... we don't always have a "theory" but it might be meaningful.

## **Targeting**

_See also_ [_Profiling: Discussion_](../../profiling-and-segmentation/profiling-discussion.md)

**Question:** If our aim is _to change the culture of giving in general_, what kind of people should we be targeting?

1. People with lots of social influence
2. Low-hanging fruit \(i.e., people who are naturally predisposed towards effective giving, pledging, & EA\)

{% hint style="success" %}
**Idea:** Compare different outreach methods on the basis of "cost per pledge" \(or per "whatever-metric-we-use"\). \(Outcomes: [Outcome: Effective gift](../../proposed-tools-for-motivating-effective-giving/oc-effective-donation-consider-effectiveness/)... & [Outcome: Pledge](../../proposed-tools-for-motivating-effective-giving/moral-duty-of-well-off/)... \)
{% endhint %}

Compare _different outreach methods_ on the basis of "cost per pledge" \(or per "whatever-metric-we-use"\). \(See [Outcome: Effective gift.](../../proposed-tools-for-motivating-effective-giving/oc-effective-donation-consider-effectiveness/).. and [Outcome: Pledge..](../../proposed-tools-for-motivating-effective-giving/moral-duty-of-well-off/). discussions.\)

### Ideas/methods for targeting: platforms and audiences

* Public lists of political donations \(e.g, [archive.org](https://github.com/daaronr/effective_giving_market_testing/tree/6930982530446fb3eca07600975697123b09c7da/contexts-and-environments-for-testing/gwwc/www.archive.org)\)
  * ... donors to candidates sympathetic to a relevant cause area
* Internet activity ... those who watch/read/search for:
  * Videos relevant to a cause area
  * Reddit threads relevant to a cause area
  * Magazines/news sites relevant to a cause area
  * Search/visiting webpages about charity effectiveness/merit \(e.g., Charity Navigator\) üëç 
* Education
  * Courses/degrees/majors relevant to a cause area 
    * \(e.g., development econ/studies, animal behavior, AI\)
  * People at high-status institutions \(future influencers/policymakers\)
* Exploiting social network structure
  * Targeting "influencers" and "central" people \(on the basis of "number of followers" / friends / etc.\)
* Key search terms \(google 'effective giving' etc\)
* Podcasts listeners \(philanthropy, economics, development & global health ...\)
