# Giving guides (+)

Objective: Test two different approaches (emotional and factual) in messaging in order to get people to download our Giving Guide.

Worked with a creative agency to develop a set of animated video ads:

* Factual (Single ad)
* Emotional (Three ads)
  * Climate change
  * Animal welfare
  * Global health and development

Version 1:

* Tested Factual vs Emotional ads
* Emotional ads performed better

Version 2:

* Factual ad did not perform as well as weâ€™d like in V1, so we shortened the animation to cut directly to a stat
* Tested Updated Factual vs Original Emotional
* This time factual performed better

Version 3:

* Wanted to test an additional creative type with the same messaging, Luke filmed videos looking straight to camera with cards
* Added new creative type and kept the existing creative
* No obvious result overall but when you drill down to the creative types
  * For factual, the animated version was much more successful
  * For emotional, in general the new video ads of Luke performed better (Clear exception is animal welfare audience)

Additional test:

* Testing emotional and factual ads vs [hypercube brand video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiFoHm7HD94\&t=3s)
* This is ongoing

Next test:

* Test an additional creative type: stock footage vs other creatives with the emotional and factual messaging
