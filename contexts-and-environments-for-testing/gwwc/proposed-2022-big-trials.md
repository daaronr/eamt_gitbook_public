## 1. ‘**Accountability partners**’:

_"Does ‘assigning/facilitating accountability partners’ improve retention and follow-through (on giving and other EA activities?_

High-value question?: Has a good chance of making an important difference, both in pledging and in being brought into EA.&#x20;

<details>

<summary>Brief case for impact</summary>

People seem to lose contact and drop out of EA after university (source?). E.g., OftW reports a loss of contact and lack of pledge fulfillment after graduation.&#x20;

Living up to promises we made to ourselves is hard. It is hard to maintain motivation, and our values and beliefs may be very much influenced by our peer groups, and by a sense of competition.&#x20;

## **2. Measuring/testing early-funnel messages/cause focus/CtA/Appeal**

We’ve identified a few aspects of the GWWC appeal (to ‘people who have already clicked and have some interest’ … coming from a podcast, How Rich Am I, etc.) that seem worth measuring and testing (our previous  evidence, prior academic evidence, our strong intuition and logic)

### **Some key variations** (focus on a subset)

* Emotional vs analytical
* Obligation framing? … (Related; Debiasing inequality)
* Which cause to lead with? (Poverty, Global warming, animals, X-risk…)
* Community framings (small clever group or large supportive movement) &#x20;
* Which specific CtA

### _**Useful to measure:**_

_**a. Which of these lead to more engagement/retention?**_\
_**b. How do the groups ‘retained’ by these different approaches differ?**_

* In initial composition, and in terms of medium run behavior.
* E.g., are those brought in with emotional, poverty, or community framings, and with pledge CtA  less interested in existential risk and  cause prioritization?

### Building general design

_But what I think we should **focus on next** is building a ‘**generic practical implementable design** _ in one setting’ for any of the above, and getting the implementation details into place. Let’s decide on, for now:

* Which audience to target
* At what point in the funnel/web page
* How we can vary the content (e.g., the text of a landing page), and how we can differentiate it in a way that allows comparison
* How we will measure and track the outcomes.
* What sample sizes and inference strategies we will use

Once we have that in place, we can choose exactly what variations want to test, optimize it, and make it happen._What do you think?_ (edited)&#x20;
