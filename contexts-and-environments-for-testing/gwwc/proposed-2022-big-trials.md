# Proposed 2022 big trials

## 1. ‘**Accountability partners**’:

Has a good chance of making an important difference, both in pledging and in being brought into EA. _Can we start to treat this as a project to start managing and make happen?_&#x20;

## **2. Measuring/testing early-funnel messages/cause focus/CtA/Appeal**

We’ve identified a few aspects of the GWWC appeal (to ‘people who have already clicked and have some interest’ … coming from a podcast, How Rich Am I, etc.) that seem worth measuring and testing (our previous  evidence, prior academic evidence, our strong intuition and logic)

### **Some key variations** (focus on a subset)

* Emotional vs analytical
* Obligation framing? … (Related; Debiasing inequality)
* Which cause to lead with? (Poverty, Global warming, animals, X-risk…)
* Community framings (small clever group or large supportive movement) &#x20;
* Which specific CtA

### _**Useful to measure:**_

_**a. Which of these lead to more engagement/retention?**_\
_**b. How do the groups ‘retained’ by these different approaches differ?**_

* In initial composition, and in terms of medium run behavior.
* E.g., are those brought in with emotional, poverty, or community framings, and with pledge CtA  less interested in existential risk and  cause prioritization?

### Building general design

_But what I think we should **focus on next** is building a ‘**generic practical implementable design** _ in one setting’ for any of the above, and getting the implementation details into place. Let’s decide on, for now:

* Which audience to target
* At what point in the funnel/web page
* How we can vary the content (e.g., the text of a landing page), and how we can differentiate it in a way that allows comparison
* How we will measure and track the outcomes.
* What sample sizes and inference strategies we will use

Once we have that in place, we can choose exactly what variations want to test, optimize it, and make it happen._What do you think?_ (edited)&#x20;
