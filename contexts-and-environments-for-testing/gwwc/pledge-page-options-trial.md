# Pledge page (options trial)

## **GWWC has three distinct pledge options: **

1\. Try Giving (1% of income),&#x20;

2\. "The Pledge" (10%), and&#x20;

3\. "Further Pledge" (donate all income above a living allowance).

These can be seen, e.g., on the 'pledge page[ HERE (wayback machine link](https://web.archive.org/web/20201001001547/https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge/) October 2020).

DR: I'm not sure if I understand the labelling and the setup fully. [Julian Hazell](https://app.gitbook.com/u/5r4JrDxg4Gb3ZrYJYfN2YWU2v6H2 "mention") [Luke Freeman](https://app.gitbook.com/u/ljuM97uRtMeH7IhMq9MSN1kuPcC3 "mention") maybe you can get in touch/help with this?
