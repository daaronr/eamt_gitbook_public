# Web page \(casual visitors\)

Lots of people \(10k per months\) come to GWWC via 

* 'How Rich am I" and more
* Home page
* Giving recommendations
* Measuring income inequality 

Self-stated ['reasons why I pledge' in some survey ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kSTVO4K8t0x15qU6Tldlh6lbbMtIA7nG5NXLchyVGfw/edit#gid=1797640165)... ranked scores for self-attribution --&gt; can use this as a basis for testing

## Landing page

* Think of the email sign-up as the important intermediate outcome

## Call to action \(above the fold\)

Which calls to action work best at getting people to give an email?

* Join a community of effective givers
* Do the most good with your donations... 

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%286%29.png)

These 'calls to action' could be tested across a range of platforms

\(Possible tool: consider elicit.org for alternative phrasings etc, \)

\(Has a list of things, including some 'offers'\), can track these people going forward by email \(or by some cookie?\), can also connect it to EA Funds ... donation outcomes

The 'generic ideas' are mostly going to surround selection

Offer ideas are likely to be tested externally ... these could have behavioural impacts. 

"If I were to get someone's email address"... what would I do

### What is the goal 

* If the email signup \(or the promotion\) itself has no impact on outcomes, the goal should be to maximize the response \(at least assuming it is sorted top-down\)
* ... but some people may skip over the email... it would be nice if we could track these people
