# Facebook ads \(GWWC\)

TLDR: would be cool to get anyone's ideas for text we could use in a facebook ad to get people to enter their email on this sheet: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14NjGg1EWRt9CtnDfZREc8oU-Z03rMarojWGsUGctdK0/edit\#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14NjGg1EWRt9CtnDfZREc8oU-Z03rMarojWGsUGctdK0/edit#gid=0)

More detail: 

I’ve discussed with Luke and David running a test in which we trial ~10 different ways to get people give emails on Facebook. Basically, people will see an ad that goes something like this:

Heading \(25 characters max\), e.g.: Learn about our pledge!

Body text \(125 characters max\), e..g,: Our public list of pledgers give a portion of their income to effective charities. Learn about adding your name to the list!

And then a box where they can add their email address. We just want to test what heading/body text seems promising, and we can use this to inform a more comprehensive test of wordings on the homepage.

It would be awesome if anybody could help come up with ideas! Basically, i think it'd be cool to come up with a broad array of options, and then choose 10 that seem to make the most sense while testing a diverse range of themes.  

To help, I made a GDoc which outlines some of the key themes we could emphasize in any test like this with ideas about how to combine them to form a message which emphasizes a combination of themes. Space will be limited in this particular test but still. I also made an excel sheet where you can enter concrete ideas to try. Links to them, and to the summary of all this in the gitbook below!

And, in case it helps to have a different view, a summary of some of the language in the different themes in the AirTable \(some still to be added\): [https://airtable.com/tblABABr8FTKr9OlW/viwdP1nmc9nMwzRYp?blocks=hide](https://airtable.com/tblABABr8FTKr9OlW/viwdP1nmc9nMwzRYp?blocks=hide)
