# Facebook ads (GWWC)

_TLDR_: We are looking for text we could use in a Facebook ad for GWWC ... that seeks to get people to enter their email...\
Please give your suggestions in the [Airtable](https://airtable.com/tblABABr8FTKr9OlW/viwdP1nmc9nMwzRYp?blocks=hide) previewed below (table: 'language') or in [this Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14NjGg1EWRt9CtnDfZREc8oU-Z03rMarojWGsUGctdK0/edit#gid=0)

The Gsheet will be integrated into the Airtable and probably erased afterwards, to avoid too many versions. But we provide the Gsheet of now as some may find it easier and it permits more commenting.

## More detail:&#x20;

I (Josh Lewis) discussed with Luke and David running a test in which we trial \~10 different ways to get people to give out their emails on Facebook. Basically, people will see an ad that goes something like this:

> Heading (25 characters max), e.g.: Learn about our pledge!

> Body text (125 characters max), e..g,: Our public list of pledgers give a portion of their income to effective charities. Learn about adding your name to the list!

And then a box where they can add their email address. We just want to test which heading/body text seems promising. We can use this to inform a more comprehensive test of wordings on the homepage.

It would be awesome if anybody could help come up with ideas! Basically, I think it'd be cool to come up with a broad array of options, and then choose 10 that seem to make the most sense while testing a diverse range of themes.

The GDoc outlines key themes we could emphasize in any test like this with ideas about how to combine them to form a message which emphasizes a combination of themes.

[Gdoc “Generating broad calls to action for GWWC from key themes”](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WLm1s8xhjds0nZbgG52VYXm7g51Unj1WdP2gqr-W\_jI/edit)

Space will be limited in this particular test, but we want to get your ideas on the best options. \_Please add \_these to the [Airtable](https://airtable.com/tblABABr8FTKr9OlW/viwdP1nmc9nMwzRYp?blocks=hide) or [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14NjGg1EWRt9CtnDfZREc8oU-Z03rMarojWGsUGctdK0/edit#gid=0), as mentioned at top.
