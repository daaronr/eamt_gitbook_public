# GWWC

{% hint style="warning" %}
We also are also working to present a more detailed statistical and graphical analysis, with transparent code and data, in the [web-book here](https://daaronr.github.io/eamt\_data\_analysis/) (very much a work in progress)\

  * <mark style="background-color:orange;">Next steps</mark>: DR and JL (& others?) to liaise with JS to extract more insight, including about giving outcomes
* [Considering text for Facebook ad for GWWC](facebook-ads-gwwc.md); ad seeks to get people to enter their email. ... (what themes?)

    * _GA: Think this should be put on hold while we continue Giving Guide tests, and then use results to inform this test later._
* Collecting ideas: aiming for testing at multiple points in the funnel ([Airtable](https://airtable.com/shrUGJuhyxrKGMEUm), Gdoc)
* Multivariate testing for CTA on the How Rich Am I? Calculator
  * Test options like: Download giving guide, make a donation, sign up to newsletter, pledge, share calculator, read more
  * Want to understand what is a good hook to keep new visitors exploring and learning

## Giving What We Can: ideas and opportunities

**Eager** to learn from existing work, run tests on GWWC platform, and support research into this.\
Brainstorms: [See shared GDOC](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Sps58H0LKvoLvzSSa2Yav3kFO1vDSVzsYXoYyWzvol0/edit#heading=h.umgv7nqt8hyj)

### **Stages of the funnel:**

1. Awareness & Consideration (Curious, [casual visitors etc](web-page-casual-visitors.md))
2. Conversion/acquisition (donate/pledge)
3. Retention (fulfill and report pledge)
4. ‘Advocacy’ (promoting GWWC to others)

### **Key questions (Luke)**

* “What should the call to action for the casual person in the funnel?”
  * “A really good default option… Make a donation first and then decide where it goes, GWWC community fund idea”
* Testing all parts of site and funnel/pledge journey; web site, welcome messages/welcome packages, reminders and thank-yous

### **Outcomes and tracking**

* ‘Followed through with reported pledge’ -- a very rare event and not a great thing to track … ‘first donation’ is better
* Bringing donation-tracking ‘in-house’ … donation dashboard, allowing better outcome tracking

### Ongoing or completed trials/promos

* **Donation page**: Split-testing ‘which pledge do you see (first)’ (try giving, GWWC, further giving)
  * Random draw, a cookie 'holds it constant by individual'
* Already encouraging ‘advocacy’ and ‘start birthday fundraisers’
* [**Youtube Remarketing**](youtube-remarketing.md)
