# GWWC

## Giving What We Can: ideas and opportunities

**Eager** to learn from existing work, run tests on GWWC platform, and support research into this.\
Brainstorms: [See shared GDOC](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Sps58H0LKvoLvzSSa2Yav3kFO1vDSVzsYXoYyWzvol0/edit#heading=h.umgv7nqt8hyj)

### **Stages of the funnel:**

1. Awareness & Consideration (Curious, [casual visitors etc](web-page-casual-visitors.md)) &#x20;
2. Conversion/acquisition (donate/pledge) &#x20;
3. Retention (fulfill and report pledge) &#x20;
4. ‘Advocacy’ (promoting GWWC to others)

### **Key questions (Luke)**

* “What should the call to action for the casual person in the funnel?”
  * “A really good default option… Make a donation first and then decide where it goes, GWWC community fund idea”
* Testing all parts of site and funnel/pledge journey; web site, welcome messages/welcome packages, reminders and thank-yous

### **Outcomes and tracking**

* ‘Followed through with reported pledge’ -- a very rare event and not a great thing to track … ‘first donation’ is better
* Bringing donation-tracking ‘in-house’ … donation dashboard, allowing  better outcome tracking

### Ongoing trials/promos

* **Donation page**: Split-testing ‘which pledge do you see (first)’ (try giving, GWWC, further giving)
  * Random draw, cookie holds it constant by individual
* Already encouraging ‘advocacy’ and ‘start birthday fundraisers’
* [**Youtube Remarketing**](youtube-remarketing.md)&#x20;
