# pre-giving-tuesday-email split test (+)

_24 Nov 2021 -- adapting this to the_ [trial-reporting-template.md](../../trial-reporting-template.md "mention") _... incorporating the_ [preregistration\_oftw\_pre\_gt.md](preregistration\_oftw\_pre\_gt.md "mention") _and the internal plan notes (below)_

## General idea, main 'hypothesis' <a href="#general-idea-main-hypothesis" id="general-idea-main-hypothesis"></a>

**Are effectiveness-minded (EA-adjacent) donors and pledgers more motivated to donate by**

1. "A": A (non-quantitative) **mention of impact and effectiveness** (as in the standard OftW pitch)
2. "B": **Emotional appeals and 'identified victim' images**

_In the context of **One for The World**'s (OFTW) 'giving season upselling campaign, potentially generalizable to other contexts._



_**Academic framing**_: "Does the Identifiable Victims Effect (see e.g., the meta-analysis by Lee and Feeley, 2016) also motivate the most analytical and committed donors?"
