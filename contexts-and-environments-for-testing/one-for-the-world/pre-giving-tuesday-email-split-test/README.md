# pre-giving-tuesday-email split test (+)

_24 Nov 2021 -- adapting this to the_ [trial-reporting-template.md](../../trial-reporting-template.md "mention") _... incorporating the_ [preregistration\_oftw\_pre\_gt.md](preregistration\_oftw\_pre\_gt.md "mention") _and the internal plan notes (below)_

## General idea, main 'hypothesis' <a href="#general-idea-main-hypothesis" id="general-idea-main-hypothesis"></a>

**Are effectiveness-minded (EA-adjacent) donors and pledgers more motivated to donate by**

1. "A": A (non-quantitative) **mention of impact and effectiveness** (as in the standard OftW pitch)
2. "B": **Emotional appeals and 'identified victim' images**

_In the context of **One for The World**'s (OFTW) 'giving season upselling campaign, potentially generalizable to other contexts._

_**Academic framing**_: "Does the Identifiable Victims Effect (see e.g., the meta-analysis by Lee and Feeley, 2016) also motivate the most analytical and committed donors?"

## Preliminary results&#x20;

(From message from Chloe)

* 10 emails total over the course of November were sent in preparation for GivingTuesday.&#x20;
* A list of \~4500 contacts (activated pledgers) was split into two treatment groups.
* Treatment Group A received emails that were focused on the contact's impact
* &#x20;while Treatment Group B received emails that were focused on individual stories of beneficiaries.&#x20;
* All 10 emails had the same CTA: make an additional $100 donation for the giving season/GivingTuesday on top of their recurring monthly pledge donation.&#x20;

Preliminary analysis shows that even with the one high-performing outlier removed from the dataset, **those emails that appealed to emotional storytelling performed better (higher in-email click rate) than those that were impact-focused**.&#x20;

Further analysis that details the way that different contact demographics interacted with each email treatment type will also be done, as well as an analysis of clicks converted to completed donations.
