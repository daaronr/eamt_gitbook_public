# pre-giving-tuesday-email split test (+)

_24 Nov 2021 -- adapting this to the_ [trial-reporting-template.md](../../trial-reporting-template.md "mention") _... incorporating the_ [preregistration\_oftw\_pre\_gt.md](preregistration\_oftw\_pre\_gt.md "mention") _and the internal plan notes (below)_

_Note: Some of the below overlaps the content in_ [preregistration\_oftw\_pre\_gt.md](preregistration\_oftw\_pre\_gt.md "mention")__

## General idea, main 'hypothesis' <a href="#general-idea-main-hypothesis" id="general-idea-main-hypothesis"></a>

**Are effectiveness-minded (EA-adjacent) donors and pledgers more motivated to donate by**

1. "A":  (non-quantitative) **presentation of impact and effectiveness** (as in standard OftW pitch)
2. "B": **Emotional appeals and 'identified victim' images**

_In the context of **One for The World**'s (OFTW) 'giving season upselling campaign', potentially generalizable to other contexts._

_**Academic framing**_: "Does the Identifiable Victims Effect (see e.g., the meta-analysis by Lee and Feeley, 2016) also motivate the most analytical and committed donors?"

## Background and context

**One for The World**'s (OFTW) 'giving season upselling campaign''

### Timing of trial

Targeted dates: November 10, November 18, November 23, all in 2021, but these may be delayed for feasibility

### Digital location where project 'lives' (planning, material, data)

Present Gitbook, Google doc linked below, preregistration (OSF), and  ??

### Environment/context for trial

Emails \
... to existing OftW pledgers (asking for additional donations in Giving Season)

### **Participant universe and sample size**

Roughly 4000 participants, as described\
****A series of three campaign emails will be sent out by OftW to their regular email lists, to roughly 4000 participants, as described

### Key treatment(s)

### **Outcome data**

Targeting: Donation incidence and amount in the relevant 'giving season' and over the next year, specifically described in prereg under...[#3-describe-the-key-dependent-variable-s-specifying-how-they-will-be-measured.](preregistration\_oftw\_pre\_gt.md#3-describe-the-key-dependent-variable-s-specifying-how-they-will-be-measured.

## Preliminary results

(From message from Chloe)

* 10 emails total over the course of November were sent in preparation for GivingTuesday.
* A list of \~4500 contacts (activated pledgers) was split into two treatment groups.
* Treatment Group A received emails that were focused on the contact's impact
* while Treatment Group B received emails that were focused on individual stories of beneficiaries.
* All 10 emails had the same CTA: make an additional $100 donation for the giving season/GivingTuesday on top of their recurring monthly pledge donation.

Preliminary analysis shows that even with the one high-performing outlier removed from the dataset, **those emails that appealed to emotional storytelling performed better (higher in-email click rate) than those that were impact-focused**.

Further analysis that details the way that different contact demographics interacted with each email treatment type will also be done, as well as an analysis of clicks converted to completed donations.
