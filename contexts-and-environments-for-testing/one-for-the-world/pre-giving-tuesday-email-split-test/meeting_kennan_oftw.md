# Chat with Kennan OftW

Managed most UG chapters
Handles most data and systems

Did coursework in Java and R. Thesis with some regression analysis.

Learned sql to create data warehouse in google bit query


Chloe pulled the test data from mailchimp

donations came from bitquery, Kennan set it up

"Giving Season contributions - website" -- everyone who donated on the website

It's difficult to donate any other way


By assigned treatment (whether or not they opened)

- open statistics
- time on page statistics?
- any click statistics
- click on CtA page (desired click)
- how many donated on web site
- how many donated in *any way* (including web site)

(All of this 'within giving season ... until 15 Jan')
Check back on the 'complete year of donation' in 1 year

Could look at 'all one time donations irrespective of platform'
Could also include a more verbose dataset
