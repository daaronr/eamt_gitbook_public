# One For the World (OftW)

## OftW: **Tip of the spear**

* <mark style="background-color:green;">Impact vs emotion:</mark> [pre-giving-tuesday-email-split-test](pre-giving-tuesday-email-split-test/ "mention") [#preliminary-results](pre-giving-tuesday-email-split-test/#preliminary-results "mention")
  * (Note: this trial is now 'public', i.e., on the public gitbook)
  * Large trial involving two variants of a sequence of emails to existing OftW pledgers/participants asking them for an additional donation (emotional email versus standard impact-based email)
  * <mark style="background-color:orange;">Next steps</mark>: further write-up, organize analysis, consider a followup
* [NYU and Texas A\&M trials](./#ongoing-completed-experiments); _<mark style="background-color:purple;">Status? Not started yet.</mark>_
* "Upselling" YouTube marketing (casual lift test, or trials?); working with JS _<mark style="background-color:purple;">Status?</mark>_

{% hint style="info" %}
_Moved to public gitbook ... link above_\

__**Restating key goals:** **activating** more donors who took the pledge at university, so that their donations actually start; retaining donors for longer once they activate;\
\
_There is a \~80% drop-out rate_

* Potentially interested in 'joining our group' and coming to (e.g.) 1x per month cross-org meetings

<!---->

* Engaging with this Gitbook and other resources

<!---->

* Tests and trials of interest -- thinking about it

<!---->

* Possibly open to collaboration with other orgs (GWWC, TLYCS etc) on

  * Corporate lunchtime talks and outreach (could be done jointly)
  * Sharing data and insights

Giving season is coming...Open to testing less disruptive and less risky stuff

*   "Testing involving activated pledgers (active donors)"

    * Doing a series of email campaigns throughout giving seasonal
      * (Notes also givingtuesday and other things)
      * Asking them to 'donate on top of' (unclear if it is additional to the 1%?)
      * this year they _are_ trying to 'upsell them' ... rem -- current goal is to 'upsell by 5 percent' ... earn an additional 5% of that 'run rate'
    * previously: 'just getting in their inbox'
    * In past, the focus has been on 'showing them their impact'
      * A quarterly impact report based on their specific donations
      * last year was centered around a match
      * (?Haven't done so in the past, but might be worth considering an emotional appeal)
    * JS suggested: Chloe at OfTw sends list of emails, JS works to put ads on Ebay or Facebook to some share of these, Chloe considers the impact of these.
      * JS suggests trying something simple so we can see something in a short run
      * YouTube: Can tell us time video spent on screen, how long they watched it...
    * Timings
      * Through december-jan they can expect to see a bunch of donations
      * could do this early on, try to compare 1 group getting one campaign and the other another campaign, or something

    _**Upshot of meeting, todo:**_
* Chloe considers reasonable variants of messaging (email or video), Josh, David, others help consider these. She runs these by Jack to see if he is OK with this
  * try for 'early testing and pivot within giving season'
* Works with JS on possible Youtube campaign lift test ...
  * (would need 'audience lists' with possible assigned splits
  * would need a video (or multiple if we need to test it)

## Resources

We are hiring a Communications Officer imminently, who will add more messaging expertise and have a lot more time for this type of work. --> this is Chloe Cudaback

We would dearly love to have donors' donation management (e.g. taking the pledge / updating a pledge etc.) entirely housed on our own site, both for donor convenience and for analytics purposes. Currently, donors log in at [donational.org](https://donational.org) to manage their pledges.
