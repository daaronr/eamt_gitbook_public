# One For the World (OftW)

## OftW: **Tip of the spear**

* <mark style="background-color:green;">Impact vs emotion:</mark> [pre-giving-tuesday-email-split-test](pre-giving-tuesday-email-split-test/ "mention") [#preliminary-results](pre-giving-tuesday-email-split-test/#preliminary-results "mention")
  * (Note: this trial is now 'public', i.e., on the public gitbook)
  * Large trial involving two variants of a sequence of emails to existing OftW pledgers/participants asking them for an additional donation (emotional email versus standard impact-based email)
  * Preliminary results: similar performance, but little power to detect effect on (low-incidence) additional donations thus far; will also consider site engagement
  * <mark style="background-color:orange;">Next steps</mark>: update with further donations, write-up, get feedback
* [NYU and Texas A\&M trials](./#ongoing-completed-experiments); _<mark style="background-color:purple;">Status? Not started yet.</mark>_
* "Upselling" YouTube marketing (casual lift test, or trials?); working with JS _<mark style="background-color:purple;">Status?</mark>_



## Background on OftW

### Some key goals

**Reinstein/Lewars conversation notes (rough)**

* activating more donors who took the pledge at university, so that their donations actually start;
* retaining donors for longer once they activate;
* Upselling donors to give more over time (either more as a raw amount, e.g. 'keeping pace' at 1% of their income; or more as a percentage, e.g. 'graduating' to take the 10% GWWC pledge)
* acquiring new donors with fewer touchpoints, e.g. via online advertising, via our website etc. (we currently get \~0 organic sign ups)

## Who/what/how to test, learn, and adapt

### **Pipeline/groups/segments**

1. **Pledgers**
2. **Active donors, i.e., "Activated pledgers"** (Chloe is thinking of segments to this and how to appeal to them)
   1. Second tier -- people who have given each months for 12+ months; "Legacy donors" (DR: maybe 1x per year high-value donors should be in this group)
3. One-time donors (these may or may not be pledgers)
4. Cancelled
5. Payment failures

* Another group worth considering: 'pledge-curious supporters'

### **Goals/actions**

* 'Activating' Pledgers as donors (pledged but not donated)
* Active donors
  * Retain
  * Upsell (maybe only to the second tier?)
* Acquiring pledges, perhaps from a 'pledge-curious group'

### **Interested in knowing more about**

* Content -- expand our ability to tell stories about the beneficiaries
  * Ways to tell these stories
* Frequency (of comms with supporters)

### **Communications contexts**

* Platforms: Social media, email flows
* Telling stories in corporate context

Typical audience have been students and young professionals, but there is interest in corporate outreach

* Zoom and **lunchtime talks in corporate contexts** (How many? These seem extremely promising)
  * How many people are activating/pledging following these lunch+learn?

## Typical donor journey:

We are in the process of creating these homepages and setting up conversion tracking. As OFTW has \~0 organic sign ups currently, we are testing for a variety of conversion routes, including: \[Todo: clarify this]

* university campus, someone I like tells me they are involved in OftW, asks me to come along with free food
* at some point I take the pledge
* It is not a highly controlled process
* asking us (staff) a question by email
* joining a group call with others wanting to learn about effective donating (Kennan as dir. of chapter management)
* taking the pledge
* making a one-off donation

## Some rough numbers

650 active donors

1500 people in pipeline (pre-activation date)

750 new people a year are recruited... thinks it would be 2-2.5k

OFTW has a donor base of \~700 active donors,

\~1650 pledged donors (who pledged but haven't started donating yet) and

\~2000 lapsed donors.

## Ongoing/completed experiments

### NYU - message testing on our homepage

We are working with Joshua Lewis and a group of students at NYU to experiment with messaging on our homepage. A full write-up of this will follow, but essentially we have chosen two new framings for OFTW's message to feature on variations of our homepage, and we're running an A/B test with the [existing homepage](https://www.1fortheworld.org) as a control.

"Existing home page as of 9 Sep 2021"

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (8) (1) (1) (1).png>)

\
\
The two messages we are testing are:

1. **T1: Identifiable victim:**\
   **How to help children like Zawadi**
   1. Zawadi was malnourished as a baby, but with help from our top charities, is now healthy, happy, and has survived her 5th birthday. If the Zawadi had died, her family would have lost a child they loved, and Zawadi would have lost a lifetime of experiences. Our top charities are among save among the most lives per dollar of any charity. The more donations these charities receive, the more children like Zawadi will survive."
2.  **T2: Who needs money more?**

    **Can you live on 99% of your income?**

    1% of the median US Salary, around $1 a day, probably makes little difference to most people’s wellbeing. However, donating it to effective charities can make a real difference. Our top charities are among the most effective in the world in terms of lives saved per dollar. Instead of spending an extra $1 a day on yourself, learn more about donating to the world’s most effective charities via the One for the World pledge.

### Texas A\&M University - activation

We are randomly sending all donors who are due to activate in three months either:

Anchor to a start date 6 months from graduation

1. a control email saying 'thank you for pledging - look out for emails from us as your approach donation #1'
2. a treatment email saying 'thank you for pledging - click here to affirm your pledge; click here to modify your pledge'

Over span 4100 took pledge. 1850 left, 1500 pipeliners, 650

Both emails come from Jack as Executive Director. We hope that people who get the treatment email will be more likely to activate.

2400 approx -- pre and post-start cancellations

### Texas A\&M University - retention / upselling

78% of dollars raised have come online

For all donors who are due to reach a donation milestone next month - that is, their 6th, 12th or 24th monthly donation - we are randomly sending them either:

Length of time for feedback is a challenge...

1. a control email saying 'thank you for pledging'
2. a treatment email saying 'thank you for pledging - do you plan to donate $x again next month, or would you like to update your donation? Click here to keep the current amount / click here to update your donation amount'

Both emails come from Jack as Executive Director. We hope that people who get the treatment email will be more likely to keep donating and/or to increase their donation amount.

## Other notes– going forward steps

9 Sep 2021

1. Potentially interested in 'joining our group' and coming to (e.g.) 1x per month cross-org meetings
2. Engaging with this Gitbook and other resources
3. Tests and trials of interest -- thinking about it
4. Possibly open to collaboration with other orgs (GWWC, TLYCS etc) on
   * Advertisement and social media campaigns and tests/trials
   * Corporate lunchtime talks and outreach (could be done jointly)
   * Sharing data and insights

#### **27 Sept 2021**

Giving season is coming...Open to testing less disruptive and less risky stuff

*   "Testing involving activated pledgers (active donors)"

    * Doing a series of email campaigns throughout giving seasonal
      * (Notes also givingtuesday and other things)
      * Asking them to 'donate on top of' (unclear if it is additional to the 1%?)
      * this year they _are_ trying to 'upsell them' ... rem -- current goal is to 'upsell by 5 percent' ... earn an additional 5% of that 'run rate'
    * previously: 'just getting in their inbox'
    * In past, the focus has been on 'showing them their impact'
      * A quarterly impact report based on their specific donations
      * last year was centered around a match
      * (?Haven't done so in the past, but might be worth considering an emotional appeal)
    * JS suggested: Chloe at OfTw sends list of emails, JS works to put ads on Ebay or Facebook to some share of these, Chloe considers the impact of these.
      * JS suggests trying something simple so we can see something in a short run
      * YouTube: Can tell us time video spent on screen, how long they watched it...
    * Timings
      * Through december-jan they can expect to see a bunch of donations
      * could do this early on, try to compare 1 group getting one campaign and the other another campaign, or something

    _**Upshot of meeting, todo:**_
* Chloe considers reasonable variants of messaging (email or video), Josh, David, others help consider these. She runs these by Jack to see if he is OK with this
  * try for 'early testing and pivot within giving season'
* Works with JS on possible Youtube campaign lift test ...
  * (would need 'audience lists' with possible assigned splits
  * would need a video (or multiple if we need to test it)

## Resources

We are hiring a Communications Officer imminently, who will add more messaging expertise and have a lot more time for this type of work. --> this is Chloe Cudaback

We would dearly love to have donors' donation management (e.g. taking the pledge / updating a pledge etc.) entirely housed on our own site, both for donor convenience and for analytics purposes. Currently, donors log in at [donational.org](https://donational.org) to manage their pledges.
