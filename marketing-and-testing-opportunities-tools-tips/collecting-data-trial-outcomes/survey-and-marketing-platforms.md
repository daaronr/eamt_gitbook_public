# Survey and marketing platforms

## Why use survey/experiment/marketing platforms?

* To test content in more depth than an A/B trial permits
* Better control over 'who is participating' and how much attention they are paying
* Things more towards 'basic background research'
* Closer to a 'representative sample'

## Some **p**articipant recruitment platforms
