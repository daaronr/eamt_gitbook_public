> My costs have been:\\

> * about $0.01 per impression
> * about $0.50 - $1.20 per click

**Targeting at Universities ... Facebook's estimates**

The _estimated_ cost per impression (?‘reach’) and per click varies with the targeted audience. In general, narrower is estimated to be more costly. I think this is about ‘a larger audience allows FB to serve the ads to a larger number of people who tend to be click-happy’\
\
_Some data points:_

* For Oxford, ‘In College’, living in the UK: They claim we will get 4-18 clicks per day for $50 per day over 2 days (29 Mar 2022 check on FB ads manager)
* If I put in Birmingham instead I get a fairly similar figure.
* If I remove the only-one-university narrowing, it gets cheaper. They claim I’ll be able to get 86-250 clicks per day for the same cost …

If you run a lot of ads FB will assign you external consultant helpers. They are somewhat helpful, but they don't seem to know everything.\
