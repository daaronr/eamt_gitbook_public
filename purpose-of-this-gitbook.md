# ðŸ“• Purpose of this gitbook

### What is the purpose of this gitbook?&#x20;

This gitbook is an <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**internal**</mark> resource for our project (note that there is also a different [public gitbook](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-MfFk4CTSGwVOPkwnRgx/s/a3YtWoUiYYfiEQrBNztC/)). The internal gitbook is a shared and centralized working space for the team to:

1. Create, share, and update project plans in one place
2. Discuss projects and make decisions
3. Report findings from studies (before sharing them in our [public gitbook](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-MfFk4CTSGwVOPkwnRgx/s/a3YtWoUiYYfiEQrBNztC/) and elsewhere)
4. Curate our resources and build a knowledge-base to be shared publicly&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
We encourage _**you**_ (yes you!) to use this space to collaborate and share your knowledge by editing pages and adding comments. If you are unfamiliar with gitbook, you will get the hang of it! Think about using it similarly to Google docs.&#x20;

Learn how to use the tool [here](processes-and-procedures/teach-me-to-use-our-tools/), read[ GitBook's guide](https://docs.gitbook.com/editing-content/editing-pages), or ask us for help getting started.

### How is this different from the public gitbook?

While the internal gitbook is a space to document how we are planning and executing projects, the three key aims of the [**public gitbook**](https://effective-giving-marketing.gitbook.io/untitled/) are to:&#x20;

1. **Convey** **who we are, what have accomplished, and the scope of our work** to funders, people in the broader EA community, and people not yet involved in the project who would be interested in joining
2. **Share tools and knowledge with** **people in the EA/global priorities community who will apply it to their work.** We are building a knowledge base. Content in the public gitbook can inform and support a diverse set of projects (i.e., implementing marketing campaigns, fundraising initiatives, academic research)&#x20;
3. **Seek feedback on our work**. This includes technical and industry feedback on implementation and academic expertise (literature reviews and frameworks to consider, methodology, and experimental design).

{% hint style="warning" %}
**All confidential or private details** will be removed before adding content to the public version (i.e., cost and ad spend, personal data)

**Information about future or ongoing trials should only be in the internal version** until the report is finalized and approved for sharing by the point of contact for the project.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
A few sections will be duplicated in the public and internal gitbooks. However, most content will be based **** in **one** of the two versions (and sometimes _linked_ in the other).
