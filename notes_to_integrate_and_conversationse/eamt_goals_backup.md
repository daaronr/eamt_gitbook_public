(FTX) Future Fund: Application (EAMT+)
This doc shared with: All members of EAMT,  Key managers at Rethink Priorities

Updated considerations:
Clearly motivate the relevance to Longtermists and FTX
 Incorporate more ‘meta’ components involving defining the problem, understanding the available resources and expertise, scoping promotion and testing environments, considering the value of different types of marketing expertise. (see DR/JS conversation)
?WHAT is the timeframe for spending this?

Todo: engage with and incorporate notes from feedback on the Forum (airtable view HERE)


Building: “EA Market Testing  (EAMT)  team: Goals, achievements, trajectory” to link or incorporate  here as well as  in Gitbook


Our proposal: focused notes and discussion
What to apply for
Very rough cost estimates in bold  (italics = ‘possible’)
‘Digital marketing consultants’
Quantitative marketing and web-site optimization, full-time, 1 year renewable: Dillon Bowen (or another quantitative and IT/savvy person) to “dynamically optimize EA orgs’ web sites”, as well as adaptive platforms, surveys, and other designs  → $250,000/year (starting in September 2022?)
Exploring the potential for hiring a marketer through consulting, contracts, interviewing
Cost: Time for project director and RA/ops liaison to explore potential approaches and candidates (budgeted below)
Paid 1-2 hour informational interviews with 5-10 candidates → $200 x 5 to 10 = $1000 to  $2000
 Hire two top candidates for specific 80-hours consulting projects (considered as test-cases) → 2 x 80 hours x $150/hour = $24,000
Qualitative and practical  industry-standard web marketing specialist consultant, 50% time, 1 year renewable → $125,000/year if we find the right person
Should have expertise on Facebook and other prominent advertising platforms
Should also be design-saavy and communications-saavy (or be able to subcontract this well)
This doesn’t have to be an EA-aligned person but but it should be someone analytical/philosophical and quantitatively literate,  gets the intricacies of EA  argument. We want them to avoid misrepresenting key concepts, and to have a solid idea of what the goals are, keeping the trials and promotions focused.
This will engage with and supplement the work done by JS Winchell and his team

Research and management
Research Assistance and Operations, field experiments and trials, marketing liaison (draw from here)... 50% time for 1 year, renewable → $38,840/year
(+ Another ‘pre-doc’ level person, maybe this project offers an opportunity to learn data science → 50% time for 1 year, renewable → $30,000/year)
Research assistance: Meta-analysis and literature synthesis (Annabel Rayner or similar ) 10-15 hours/week for the barriers scoping/literature survey, to clearly explain how it connects and helps the larger project. This includes ‘ideas to test’, background evidence to weigh new evidence against, engaging academia, and meta-analysis to build a stronger evidence base. → $15,000/year
Project co-director: Reinstein 40-50% time as a backup in the event of non-renewal of LongView grant → About $50,000/year buy-off from RP (some caveats here)
‘Digital marketing consultant(s)’ (who is it, what it would costs) [ask people like Arden, JS, …] … [does it have to be an EA person? ]
‘Technical advice’
At least one person who gets quant stuff and data sci stuff
This is additional to what JS is doing … we need more of this

“Direct (field) experiments and trials”

‘EAMT-directed’ trials (working with one or more organizations and/or cross-platform can do it parallel for orgs
Generalizability
Could just run a bunch of our own A/B tests designed to answer questions that are quite general to a lot of EA orgs and/or academically interesting.
Aside: Would be great if we could find a way of doing random assignment on one platform. I doubt it’s possible but might be if we knew enough. This would be a game changer. If we could program randomization ourselves *after the relevant auction took place*, that might do it.

Reinstein: Facebook birthdays, Justgiving seeds, scaling up these high-impact trials → $100,000
Supplemental Mturk and survey work

?(Ask the orgs if this would help) Cover ‘setaside time’ for people at relevant EA orgs to devote to the public goods aspect of this project [but will this help?]
(Minor): Tech/software support. (E.g., a full license for Gitbook)
Low priority: conference/travel to meet and discuss?
Hire a Phd or Postgraduate student (who might also be attracted to the opportunity to be involved with an important part of a big experiment)
Something related to/for Dillon Bowen? (I want to ‘enable him to push forward’)
Issue: contexts where adaptive design is possible
More ‘data sci people’ to help him?
Yes… and or tech people to help us use his randomization procedure in digital ads…
Digital marketing tech support, consultancy, mentorship.
Would be great to know how to collect as much data on peoples’ responses to our ads as possible - e.g., more than what we can get off of Facebook and Google.
How to build and use display adverts and potentially conduct our own randomization procedures

How to justify it
See (and integrate) https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ok9b51p5aQ1qHFnrGkf_e7vsjnDWzWdU_Zv3eUCtEL4/edit#

What concrete projects or research questions could we answer that would seem like “aiming big”? E.g.:
What technological solutions are there to get us (blockcd) random assignment in digital advertising?
Could we set up infrastructure for recruiting high value survey participants?
Could we fund the development of software (like Dillon’s) but that would do things like scrape all survey-taker’s data from Facebook and LinkedIn etc.. if they consented? (could get far more useful data this way, potentially, although, this could only be done in a very high trust environment).
Building a model of the ‘most useful thing to suggest to an individual’ for the EA movement, as a function of the individual’s observable traits (e.g., ‘suggest computer scientists consider an AI safety career).. Building algorithms to automatically figure out what to display those people based on this framework.
Building reports on specific marketing questions (and meta-questions) without necessarily testing things ourselves,
(btw, if Erin worked on some of these reports, she could be more of a “Researcher” than a research assistant… this might have some benefits)
e.g., “What is the best way to recruit a marketing expert?” Some of this is directly Longtermist Messaging and marketing (M&m)
‘Non-LT’ EA ideas and involvement is adjacent and a gateway drug to LT-ism
Knowing ‘how to do marketing/convince people’  and building a research team focused on this will carry over to LT’ist M&m
Our team will focus on research review, study design, analysis, communication, sharing, validation, feedback, etc. JS’ team will focus on implementation details, and we’ll collaborate closely. (We may also leverage and help  RP’s work on this stuff; see below)

Josh: the more we can concretely spell out the better…

“Which platform works best” will not be stable
Practical insights bringing people in now (GWWC pledge page, GWWC ad about ‘few people research charity’)...  will impact the trajectory
What other org will emerge?

… or more concretely promoting LT-ist causes … nuclear war, climate, pandemic risk

Note that ‘marketing to elites’ seems to be a big part of it.

If this is about ‘making the top 1-2 people in each generation EA is there a path to impact?:
Josh “We make Harvard/Princeton as EA as possible” …
i. peer pressure makes Einstein EA and
 ii. What works to convince physicists will convince Einstein

Other discussion…
Should we link arms with Rethink Priorities in some way, as they (we) are doing a bunch of LT-ist messaging stuff and adjacent also?

Feedback from Ozzie:
Would be really useful to have a legit marketing expert on board.
There is a possibility that all our insights end up useless to a really well-resourced, highly competent marketer who would want to figure everything out from scratch. We would have to articulate why we would not expect this to be the case
If we could figure out the value of certain EA aligned behaviors, e.g., the value of somebody reading Will’s new book according to their potential or an intro to effective altruism, and how much it costs to get them to do it, we could potentially do large scale marketing. Not necessarily just at Harvard students
Should ask Arden at 80k about a marketing person they are using - probably talking to as many marketing people as possible is good
A major part of this project is just segmenting our “market” and figuring out what is the best we can do with each segment and how much on average that is worth to the EA movement

Your project

Does this proposal fall under one of the areas in our "Areas of Interest" page? If so, what area does it fall under? (It's fine if the answer is no.)

Yes: “Effective Altruism” (building the community)
We’re very excited about growing the effective altruism community. And we want to critically examine its ideas, to help ensure that effective altruists cultivate open-mindedness, resist insular thinking, and avoid homogeneity.

We think that expanding the effective altruism community will get more people working on critical problems for securing humanity’s future. That includes the problems listed on this page, as well as problems we haven’t discussed here or aren’t yet aware of.
By thoughtfully expanding the effective altruism community, we can also improve the quality of its decision-making, by drawing upon a wider range of experiences and points of view. As the EA community grows, it needs to strengthen its efforts to increase its racial, gender, geographical, and educational diversity. We want to find the most effective strategies for doing so. And we want to continue building out EA student groups at universities, especially in parts of the US and the world that are currently underrepresented in EA.

We want to see effective altruism grow, but we also think it’s extremely important that effective altruists don’t fall prey to insularity. That’s why the Future Fund is eager to receive proposals for funding and collaboration from anyone who wants to protect the long-term future—regardless of whether they identify as effective altruists, longtermists, or anything else.

Notes conversation with Dillon
We can really buy his time now but it sounds like you might be interested in a full-time job doing this stuff after he gets his PhD … in   one and a half years if I understand right.
Our take was that we think you cannot adapt our “own tools” (e.g., Dillons adaptive design algorithm/software) to Facebook, Google, or YouTube ads. However, we can adapt their own tools to optimize and websites of these organizations and other parts of the funnel.
‘Web site optimization’ … if there’s a tool available that’s great
Had some ideas about improving attribution … something with the tag at the end of the url in the video
