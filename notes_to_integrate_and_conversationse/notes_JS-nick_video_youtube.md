# Notes on convo with JS and Nick 6 Aug 2021

JS worked with GWWC on remarketing videos
These can be repurposed for a Youtube trial

Nick is doing some stuff for Luke

- ideas about how to optimize over multiple modes

"drop the FB pixel"

With CRM of GWWC multiple

Most interested in the donation and signup outcomes ... 'we should just run stuff in the field'

we have an ad buyer -- JS, google ad grant (10k per month) ... FB also has a grant

2 outcomes -- awareness but more important is signup to donate


In addition to the YT -- Nick's team can do also FB and Instagram search ads


JS and Nick can builld the infrastructure

Interest and demo based targeting

Lookalike audience


JS -- youtube is a bit different, people don't click right away... harder to track.

Nick -- Branch and Amplitude/apply/segment ... to track someone throughout the whole funnel
JS thinks this is a 'crux' question ... if so, then JS ads are missing a crucial piece of info
Nick and JS needs to track the specifics of the measurement

We should put something together on test/control Dmas ... unless Nick has a magic solution

Josh on the independence of observations ... if the targeting is dynamic and adjusted (adaptive)

\$ 5000  per DMA


Nick -- Add someone like Grant@givemomentum to the next call

JS -- pick a project that is easy to get something going ... like starting with the videos we talked about
... start by thinking about a lift test


Nick has ideas about which mediums work well


FB and Insta as different mediums

JS on costs and expenditure:

- For 3 Dmas -- Seattle, Indianapolis, Denver

6000 USD for Seattle, 3k for Indianapolis, Portland, etc.

Idea was 3 blasts, each running for 2 weeks ... each person sees it 6 times.

DMA's better than Zip code because people do not stay in the zip code
180 Dmas in the USA

Methodology on this -- what people seem to think is the better practice

How much does it cost to target a zip code .... $1200 for 3 blasts to target the top-5 zip codes

Funding sources:
- GWWC
- GW
- Nick
- What else?

Or we could build the 'optimal plan' research-wise ... then we make the case and ask for funds

- bring a few options to the table ...  most Robust, Less Robust

DR: Will need a prior on the returns to a test, and then for a certain number of tests we can anticipate how much we are likely to learn

Josh -- agrees with JS that we could start to try something to learn about the thing in general

Josh -- we should also think about 'more money means more things we can test'

---

# GWwC Google free ads grant

The free money is just for search, we can brainstorm a way to test it

- send people to landing pages on GWWC  messaging about obligation and opportunity
- actual text of Google search ads, it has its own algorithm it seems for identifying the best messaging...

need highest value outcomes: Insert email address ... .

What are highest value?
