# Notes Jack Lewars


Agrees that OFTW is good at raising for GW charities ... less convinced that OFTW creates impactful EAs (?) or LT-ist in output


Most explicitly short-termist org in EA

The sweet spot is about deepening engagement

Agrees that increasing small things is not important
1% pledge is important but not earth shattering

Difficulty is getting people to fulfill this, the lifetime pledge
80% stop donating over the first 5 years

If they can increase the percentage of people who fulfill the pledge ... stay donating by 5 or 10 percent, the compound effect would be large

Good at recruiting; 1k max before the pledge

Drop-off is the pain point.


Common interest with LV -- get people to engage and stay engaged

My 'three basic pillars of EA commitment'

Think we are good at explaining the analytical part ...


Thinks "effective giving is one of the best way to explain it to people' ... GWWC and oftw use the same slides. How many healthy lives do you get for 1k us donation ... hearts presentation


Reason they are skeptical is that the 1 percent pledge ... wont get more than 10x as many people. (But they don't care)

(But this argument shouldn't affect)
GWWC is a larger scale ... or at least more well known.


...

Trying to turbocharge and scale OftW ... dir of volunteer outreach, from outside of EA; a political person or Animal outreach

Tap in mainstream tactics ... if you want to take EA mainstream

Will help with a charitable giving stuff if we defined 'what we want ot do' that everyone signed up on

It has been scattershot. WE could define the 'key things to test and goals' and get the orgs to sign on to testing this
