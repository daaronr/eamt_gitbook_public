# Meeting with Jason Anderson, Givewell

Jason Anderson was brought in to focus on retention of under 10k donors

Marketing was charged with rebranding them to capture a broader share of the market

Did some segmentation and some message testing

'moving a ridiculous amount of money, building research side to consider where to give it all'

Focusing on retention and moving people up through the chain

Lots of 'opens' but few responses to emails. Thinks people give according to a certain cycle.

incredibly careful/neurotic about what they are willing to say and how

...

Messaging -- Shifted towards a 'donor focused message' -- but didn't test it, it just seemed obvious

Newsletter that is research focused, impact emails...

Big effect on open rate but hard to follow further

3 months of treatment/control group with some additional communications, at least 1-2 solicitations, event invitation. A substantial impact on retention and amount gave a bit.

Finds identifiable victim marketing to be exploitive/slimey.

...

Outreach: changed privacy policy without notice ...


Podcasts are the major success
But haven't been doing much testing in those areas

Sourcing donations when they come to website, followup survey in terms of 'where you found us'

Interested in putting more into podcasts. Assumes they are open to collab subject to privacy restrictions.

Limitations on what we are willing to say and how... 'we search for the charities that save or improve lives per dollar'. All about factual and scientific accuracy.

...

Focus groups, very helpful to be exposed to data and other organizations' experience

Focus on donors 'what is impact and what is important to them'

...

Shifted strategy to focus on higher-value donors after an influx of lower-value donors

...

If we have a followup meeting lets include some of our marketing groups


research constraints ... RFM+ giving capacity

Highest groups will get most attention

Marketing side has not been going into profiling and finding new markets

as a marketer knowing the 'target market demo' isn't enough; wants to know what channels they use

worth knowing more about Open Phil grants .. there being onboard might be convincing to them. They are more willing to look into things outside the normal space.

...

'Ship your database of existing customers up to epsilon etc'

Doubling new donors, we are doing really well, something is working, how do we do that better? Or 'are we looking to open up new markets'?

He had questions about what we were up to and our prioriities

We could also push on some things that we think they should be doing 


Most interested in:
1. Top of funnel ad content
2. Biggest channel is podcast but harder to do testing on
3. Interested in web content 


Best web practices testing, the checkout 

Retention

PR nd influencers

Messaging choice: 
- convince an EA mindset upfront, or give a donation based on an emotional responseo

Top-heavy ... a small number of donors give a lot... optimize dollars vs donors 


High bar for wthically sourced photos 

NO issue with speed to communicate impact ... but ' what will they stand behind'

Unlikely to want to broaden the set of charities

Ben: What are the key measurable outcomes ... how likely are you to care about 'time spent at GW'?


'dollars directed to orgs they recommend * effectiveness' is the ultimate goal

... whether processed through them or somewhere else

bias towards 'processed by GW ... so they can test it'

Our DV is 'how far do they get towaards donating via givewell'?

Love to look at whether 'time spent on GW' has any knock on outcomes

Not doing anything until January
