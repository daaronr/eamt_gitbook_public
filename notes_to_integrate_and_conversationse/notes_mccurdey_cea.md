# Notes Reinstein-McCurdy (CEA, UGAP) 20 May 2022


## What are they doing and how does it relate to other initiatives?

Once we have 1-2 people at a given university interested in EA ... they have done an intro fellowship

They can apply to the accelerator program. Connects with a mentor, stipends, funding.
Run their own intro program. 'consistently performing way' to get groups started.


Some weighting towards elite universities when allocating mentors, but not limited to elite unis

Talent ID at unis.


Seeded the Georgetown group, also did NW and McGill groups
Pilot last fall with 7 groups, this Spring did 30.

Chose from people who had reached out to CEA about starting a group.

Over 50 have expressed interest, because want to scale sustainably.

If there is a group doing UGAP ... but


See "Which universities did UGAP last semester?"

I have access to the interest form -- Jon or Brian would have sent over, the group organizer information



## Explain what I'm doing

## How can I help them

### What quant questions do they have?

1. Bottleneck with a lot of groups is 'how to market their fellowships'

2.  Hiring someone who will be running experiments at universities to test 'what works in community building' ... some will lend them to what we are doing.


Organizers and marketing ... Jess has a 'high level of understanding' through UGAP about what works.

Question about 'vetting of groups' ... a sensitivity


Being on the Slack would be useful.

In work trial phase of hiring, will put me in contact in a few weeks.

"Attracting the right types of people" is very important as a theme.
More succesful if an ad campaign recruited 5 people who did impact careers.  HEA as a proxy metric.

Worth scheduling a followup  meeting.


### What trials/tests might they consider

### Do they want to be part of EAMT in some way?

## What are their thoughts on the Future Leaders thing
