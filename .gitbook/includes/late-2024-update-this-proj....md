**Late-2024 update: This project is on hiatus/moved**

_Note from David Reinstein:_ The EA Market Testing team has not been active since about August 2023. Some aspects of this project have been subsumed by Giving What We Can and their Effective Giving Global Coordination and Incubation (lead: [Lucas Moore](http://www.effectivealtruismwestchester.org/lucas-moore.html)). &#x20;

_Nonetheless, you may find the resources and findings here useful. I'm happy to answer questions about this work._&#x20;

I am now mainly focused on making [The Unjournal](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-MfFk4CTSGwVOPkwnRgx/s/-MkORcaM5xGxmrnczq25/) a success. I hope to return to some aspects of the EAMT and effective giving research projects in the future. If you are interested in engaging with this, helping pursue the research and impact, or funding this agenda, please contact me at daaronr@gmail.com.
