## Latest/best campaigns, trials, initiatives

### [One for the World](tip-o-the-spear.md#oftw)


* <mark style="background-color:green;">Impact vs emotion:</mark> [pre-giving-tuesday-email-split-test](contexts-and-environments-for-testing/one-for-the-world/pre-giving-tuesday-email-split-test/ "mention") [#preliminary-results](contexts-and-environments-for-testing/one-for-the-world/pre-giving-tuesday-email-split-test/#preliminary-results "mention")



* <mark style="background-color:green;">Impact vs emotion:</mark> [pre-giving-tuesday-email-split-test](contexts-and-environments-for-testing/one-for-the-world/pre-giving-tuesday-email-split-test/ "mention") [#preliminary-results](contexts-and-environments-for-testing/one-for-the-world/pre-giving-tuesday-email-split-test/#preliminary-results "mention")
    * Large trial involving two variants of a sequence of emails to existing OftW pledgers/participants asking them for an additional donation (emotional email versus standard impact-based email)
    * Preliminary results: little power to detect effect on (low-incidence) additional donations thus far; will also consider site engagement
    * <mark style="background-color:orange;">Next steps</mark>: update with further donations, write-up, get feedback

* [NYU and Texas A\&M trials](contexts-and-environments-for-testing/one-for-the-world/#ongoing-completed-experiments); _<mark style="background-color:purple;">Status? Not started yet.</mark>_&#x20;


* "Upselling" YouTube marketing (casual lift test, or trials?); working with JS _<mark style="background-color:purple;">Status?</mark>_

### [GWWC](tip-o-the-spear.md#gwwc)

*   "[Pledge page" split-test](contexts-and-environments-for-testing/gwwc/pledge-page-options-trial.md#general-idea-main-hypothesis); vary presentations of pledge options (tied to cookies/IP addresses)

    _<mark style="background-color:yellow;">We have</mark>_ [some results](contexts-and-environments-for-testing/gwwc/pledge-page-options-trial.md#ex-post-reporting-results-brief) <mark style="background-color:yellow;">(incidence rates and Google's metrics); see DR's summary suggesting that 'presenting the simple 10% pledge in relative isolation' might lead to the most conversions</mark>

    * <mark style="background-color:orange;">Next steps</mark>_<mark style="background-color:yellow;">: more detailed analysis and write-up (check/replicate/extend Google optimize Bayesian analysis in code)</mark>_
* [YouTube remarketing](contexts-and-environments-for-testing/gwwc/youtube-remarketing.md).&#x20;
  * V prelim results: benchmarks on cost per view, relative performance of best/worst videos &#x20;
  * <mark style="background-color:orange;">Next steps</mark>: DR and JL (& others?) to liaise with JS to extract more insight, including about giving outcomes
* [Considering text for Facebook ad for GWWC](contexts-and-environments-for-testing/gwwc/facebook-ads-gwwc.md); ad seeks to get people to enter their email. ... (what themes?)
  * _<mark style="background-color:purple;">Status?</mark>_
    * _GA: Think this should be put on hold while we continue Giving Guide tests, and then use results to inform this test later._
* Collecting ideas: aiming for testing at multiple points in the funnel ([Airtable](https://airtable.com/shrUGJuhyxrKGMEUm), Gdoc)
* Multivariate testing for CTA on the How Rich Am I? Calculator
  * Test options like: Download giving guide, make a donation, sign up to newsletter, pledge, share calculator, read more
  * Want to understand what is a good hook to keep new visitors exploring and learning

### [The Life You Can Save](contexts-and-environments-for-testing/tlycs/)

* Various trials with JS, including [advisor-signup-portland](contexts-and-environments-for-testing/tlycs/advisor-signup-portland/ "mention") city-level Youtube test;&#x20;
  * Preliminary results: very low 'advisor signup' response, underpowered; <mark style="background-color:orange;">Next steps</mark>: difference in difference in difference analysis of how many sessions (by pre/post, year-to-year, Portland vs other), to see if the ad lead to clicks
* Considering a '[funds recommendations trial'](contexts-and-environments-for-testing/tlycs/funds-recommendations-trial.md) with different options and 'prompted consideration'. <mark style="background-color:purple;">Status?</mark>

### 80000 hours

* [youtube-awareness-upenn-+.md](contexts-and-environments-for-testing/80000-hours/youtube-awareness-upenn-+.md "mention") Results? <mark style="background-color:purple;">Status?: holdup with the ads, need to deal with a legislative thing</mark> &#x20;

Bella's goals and interests:&#x20;

* optimize WoM channels, referral campaign
* sponsorships (sponsor a podcast, youtube)&#x20;
* 80k and Tim Ferris (a bit confounded with different CtA) ...&#x20;

## Meeting agendas and recordings

### Planned meeting(s) for early January

_DR: As we cannot all make a time, I propose two meetings; which should allow at least 1 person from each org to make a meeting_  [(Slack thread on this)](https://givingexperiments.slack.com/archives/C0298MCQK4G/p1640277221038700)\
**Friday, Jan 7, 3-4pm New York,**\
**Sunday, Jan 9, 9:00-10pm New York**

Please don’t feel compelled to come to both, but try to come to one. We will have an agenda for each, and record and take notes on each.

#### **Agenda**

_Overview below --_ [_see Google doc details/discussion space HERE for more details and interaction_](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WCvQq7HEHDzJ\_DcvejzM9Y67hFr9UHYaBXVY260Dlj4/edit?usp=sharing)__

1. Introduce new people/orgs/projects
   * Bella @ 80k
   * Fitz/Momentum
   * Ptashnik and profiling
   * New people/meets: Bilal@TLYCS, Grace@GWWC, others?&#x20;
2. discuss testing objectives (?)
3. What we're all up to; debrief results of studies we've run (other than those covered before) -- see [#latest-best-campaigns-trials-initiatives](tip-o-the-spear.md#latest-best-campaigns-trials-initiatives "mention")
4. Discuss: the 'public version'/public reporting of trial results, 'newsletter'
5. "Why report and share (with the [template](contexts-and-environments-for-testing/trial-reporting-template/))?": If you do, academics/researchers will do analysis of data, put in context with other data, meta-analysis&#x20;
6. ‘Task management’: who does what and how do we organize it? Do we need other sources of funding for time? (see discussion in [Gdoc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WCvQq7HEHDzJ\_DcvejzM9Y67hFr9UHYaBXVY260Dlj4/edit#))



Jan 7 (Friday): OftW (Chloe), possibly 80k (Bella) present

Jan 9 (Sun): GWWC (Grace), TLYCS (Bilal), possibly 80k (Bella) present; also JS Winchell
