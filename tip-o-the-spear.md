## EAMT: organizational updates and callouts

**DR:** Longview renewal funding is coming through partially; funding my time for a 6 month 'prove value to creating EAs'; \
No funding for RA/ops/data support ATM (seeking funding for this).  I'm pushing forward on some key value-demonstration projects including

* ["EA uni groups for future leaders"](contexts-and-environments-for-testing/ea-university-groups-for-future-leaders-ftx/) \
  the ['open and clear presentation of results' book](https://daaronr.github.io/eamt\_data\_analysis/index.html), &#x20;
* 'client-focused creating-EA results' for GWWC, 80k, others,  &#x20;
* Putting together (gdoc, seeking feedback) ["EAMT: high-value questions (themes/projects)"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jyn\_6aFt7z1kDo-6sHm9o\_ccPgEvig1b6c8OqPRH2eI/edit#heading=h.gjcw9rquq2um) ... with cross-organization value

All item listed in March-May tab below are still current (unless crossed out)
