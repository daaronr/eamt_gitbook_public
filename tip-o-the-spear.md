# ðŸ—¡ Tip-o-the-spear

## Latest/best campaigns, trials, initiatives

### [One for the World](tip-o-the-spear.md#oftw)

1. [pre-giving-tuesday-email-split-test-+](contexts-environments-plans-tests/one-for-the-world-oftw/pre-giving-tuesday-email-split-test-+/ "mention")

* Large trial involving two variants of a sequence of emails to existing OftW pledgers/participants asking them for an additional donation (emotional email versus standard impact-based email)
  * Preliminary results: similar performance, but little power to detect effect on (low-incidence) additional donations thus far; will also consider site engagement
* <mark style="background-color:orange;">Next steps</mark>: update with further donations, write-up, get feedback

**2. Outreach: Finalizing trials at select universities**

### [GWWC](tip-o-the-spear.md#gwwc)

*   "[Pledge page" split-test](contexts-environments-plans-tests/gwwc/pledge-page-options-trial.md#general-idea-main-hypothesis); vary presentations of pledge options (tied to cookies/IP addresses)

    _<mark style="background-color:yellow;">We have</mark>_ [some results](contexts-environments-plans-tests/gwwc/pledge-page-options-trial.md#ex-post-reporting-results-brief) <mark style="background-color:yellow;">(incidence rates and Google's metrics); see DR's summary suggesting that 'presenting the simple 10% pledge in relative isolation' might lead to the most conversions</mark>

    * <mark style="background-color:orange;">Next steps</mark>_<mark style="background-color:yellow;">: more detailed analysis and write-up (check/replicate/extend Google optimize Bayesian analysis in code)</mark>_
* [YouTube remarketing](contexts-and-environments-for-testing/gwwc/youtube-remarketing.md).
  * V prelim results: benchmarks on cost per view, relative performance of best/worst videos
* Considering and preparing a range of further tests into outreach messaging, content, and calls to action.

### [The Life You Can Save](contexts-environments-plans-tests/tlycs.md)

* Ambitious city-level Youtube advertising tests; gaining benchmark measures for 'cost of page views' and other outcomes
* Considering other content-related trials

### 80000 hours

* Finalizing an advertising awareness campaign at a single university

### Profiling work

* [David Reinstein is working with Thomas Ptashnik to analyze the German SOEP data](profiling-and-segmentation/previous-work/other-work-and-data.md), to gain insights into 'what predicts and motivates support for international redistribution' and key components of 'EA mentality' (especially generosity and cosmopolitanism)

### Reinstein & Co

Pushing forward 'self and academic-funded large trials', ideally before giving season

* JustGiving social giving trial (details redacted because ongoing)
* Facebook encouraging fundraisers trial (details redacted because ongoing)
* Integrating evidence from (own and others') field experiments on the '[impact of impact information in charitable campaigns'](https://daaronr.github.io/dualprocess/index.html); original and meta-analysis
  * "New": DonorsVoice/CRS, ICRC [#icrc-quick-overview](contexts-environments-plans-tests/charities-fundraisers-and-impact-information/icrc-quick-overview-+.md#icrc-quick-overview "mention")
  * 'Published': Karlan and Wood (2017), Bergh and Reinstein (2020)
* Updates to ["Increasing effective giving"](https://daaronr.github.io/ea\_giving\_barriers/index.html) synthesis, and to resources in this gitbook
