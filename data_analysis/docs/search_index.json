The top 10% household income households were targeted with (one of?) three categories of videos. The details are presented in our (currently private) gitbook HERE 1.2 Capturing data I (David Reinstein) did a manual ‘create report and download’ in TLYCS google analytics, basically as described here The report and it’s parameters can be accessed here, if you have access. Report: 3-31 December 2021 vs prior year, same dates All North American cities with 1 or more user TODO: fix to make it 1+ user for 2020 not 2021 Counts: Users, sessions, certain types of conversions (see below) I downloaded this as an Excel spreadsheet effective_giving_market_testing/data_do_not_commit/tlycs/tlycs_dec_2021_vs_2020_by_city_n_america_pos_users.xlsx (This is gitignored so it won’t be ‘committed’ to our repo, at least for now) 1.3 Input and clean data #tl21 &lt;- read_excel(here::here(&quot;data_do_not_commit&quot;, &quot;tlycs&quot;, &quot;tlycs_dec_2021_vs_2020_by_city_n_america.xlsx&quot;), sheet = &quot;Dataset1&quot;) #this should have worked? tl21 &lt;- readxl::read_excel(&quot;~/githubs/effective_giving_market_testing/data_do_not_commit/tlycs/tlycs_dec_2021_vs_2020_by_city_n_america.xlsx&quot;, sheet = &quot;Dataset1&quot;) %&gt;% as_tibble() Create ‘year’ feature tl21 &lt;- tl21 %&gt;% mutate( year = case_when( str_detect(`Date Range`, &quot;2021&quot;) == TRUE ~ 2021, str_detect(`Date Range`, &quot;2020&quot;) == TRUE ~ 2020 ) ) Create ‘differences across years’ features.
