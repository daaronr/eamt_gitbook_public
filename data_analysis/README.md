#data_analysis

This folder is intended as a place where we do and document all of the data analysis, and produce dynamic documents and other reports. We will try to use open science and clean coding approaches, making it as replicable and reasoning-transparent as possible. We will not store any (sensitive) data in this folder. Sensitive data is in the parallel “data” folder which is get ignored. Where possible we will have this pulled data down directly from APIs with passwords. We will try to integrate this with the private and later public “Gitbook”, although this may not be so easy to do. For now I will work in R and R markdown and create “bookdowns” which will be hosted here or elsewhere.
