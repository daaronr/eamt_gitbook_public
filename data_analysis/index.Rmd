## Tech and collophon

This is styled based on the Rethink Priorities '[Bookdown template](https://github.com/rethinkpriorities/bookdown-template)' ...  and you may wish to manually update from there

Note that this is a 'bookdown site in the gitbook style'. However, we're not sure yet if and how it can be integrated with the `https://app.gitbook.com/`.

Note this is currently in the same github repo as the related  `https://app.gitbook.com/` project linked above.
