[Innovations in fundraising ‘knowledge base’](https://innovationsinfundraising.org/doku.php#knowledge\_base) and [‘Experience of workplace activists’](https://innovationsinfundraising.org/doku.php?id=iifwiki:experiences\_of\_workplace\_activists) … was the knowledge sharing I tried to get going (as you can see, not very much was shared)… as an academic, with very limited funds.

* How to get your organization to support effective charities (or at least, not limit their generosity to local causes)?
* E.g., [I tried to put together a database on FTSE-100 firms](https://innovationsinfundraising.org/doku.php?id=iifwiki:employee\_giving\_schemes) that offered giving incentives, and whether these were ’EA-promising”

<summary>Consideration: Key obstacles/questions for workplace action </summary>

"Format questions:"

1. Which audiences
2. Who (internal/external)
3. What formats? Fundraiser and a talk or just one?

Workshop, giving game, etc?

Workshop: a guided discussion ... why do you give etc. "I want to help more" etc. Workshop/worksheet. Philanthropic goals The 'five whys'? Keep asking why and they sometimes get down to base suffering. 'Guiding but not leading'.
