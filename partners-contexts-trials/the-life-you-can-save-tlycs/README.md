# The Life You Can Save (TLYCS)

We have completed various trials in conjunction with [The Life You Can Save](https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/), the most recent being the[advisor-signup-portland.md](advisor-signup-portland.md "mention") city-level YouTube test. There are a number of additional proposed trials and tests, however, at the moment these considerations are limited to the private Gitbook.

\
Note that in the past TLYCS has worked with the Graduate Policy Workshop School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University, who produced the ['Behavioral Insights to End Global Poverty'](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-Mf8cHxdwePMZXRTKnEE%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-f50d8b78d3244b5dc6ad32998a469ea2dc5ec4cd%2FBehavioral\_insights\_to\_end\_global\_poverty\_12-15.pdf?alt=media) report embedded below.

<details>

<summary>Quick takeaways from the "Princeton" report </summary>

(From 'summary'... the report authors' takes are given _except where italicized_)

* 5 key principles: choice architecture, social norms, empathy, overhead cost aversion, and anchoring

**Factual:**

* TLYCS demographics are predictable (White, Male, tech...)
* Donations cluster at the end of the tax year

**Pages and promotion**

* Social media channel is promising
* The "Best charities" page underperforms: there is a high bounce rate
  * _DR: Maybe because Givewell etc do better at this?_
* "Visual presentation of charities does have an effect
  * _DR: Not clear how this is causally identified_
* Ran "social media tests' they claim are underpowered.
  * _DR:_ but these could be analyzed with Bayesian methods for actionable insights
* They suggest simplified presentation/navigation, and a 'decision tree quiz' to reduce cognitive load
