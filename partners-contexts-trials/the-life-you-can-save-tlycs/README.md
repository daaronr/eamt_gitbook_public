# The Life You Can Save (TLYCS)

We have completed various trials in conjunction with [The Life You Can Save](https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/), the most recent being the[advisor-signup-portland.md](advisor-signup-portland.md "mention") city-level YouTube test. There are a number of additional proposed trials and tests, however, at the moment these considerations are limited to the private Gitbook.

\
Note that in the past TLYCS has worked with the Graduate Policy Workshop School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University, who produced the ['Behavioral Insights to End Global Poverty'](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-Mf8cHxdwePMZXRTKnEE%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-f50d8b78d3244b5dc6ad32998a469ea2dc5ec4cd%2FBehavioral\_insights\_to\_end\_global\_poverty\_12-15.pdf?alt=media) report embedded below.&#x20;
