# Introduction

### **Our primary approach and goals**

Our main approach 'to identify the most effective, scalable strategies for marketing EA and EA-adjacent ideas and actions' ... is 'running real-world marketing trials and experiments with EA-aligned organizations'.

We systematically vary the messaging, framing, and contexts, and map out the space of 'what works better where?'

In the **Partner Organizations and Trials section**, you will find reports of the trials we have run with organizations, including [gwwc](gwwc/ "mention") and [one-for-the-world-oftw](one-for-the-world-oftw/ "mention").

_We believe this approach is likely to be the most fruitful because:_

1. Using naturally-occurring populations in real-world settings, and focusing on meaningful costly choices and outcomes ...will lead to more relevant findings than (e.g.) convenience samples of undergraduates or professional survey participants who are aware that they are doing a research study. We anticipate greater:

* "Internal validity": our results are less likely to be driven by acquiescence bias and other artifacts of 'knowing you are in a study', and 'making hypothetical decisions', and
* "External generalizability/environmental relevance": the context we are testing in or similar to or identical to the contacts we care about.
  * (Of course generalizability from one context to another remains an important issue)

2\. We will "learn by doing" through running these, including learning about un-anticipated obstacles and learning about the practical [implementation issues](../marketing-and-testing-opportunities-tools-tips/implementation-and-collecting-data-issues/) involved with advertising, promotion and communication.

* ... and we will share what we learn with the relevant EA orgs and audiences, so they can 'stand on our shoulders' rather than having to 'make the same mistakes again and again'

3\. The trials should _themselves_ have positive direct value (in promoting EA etc), in addition to the research and learning gains. (And the downside risk seems low: We are generally not testing risky messages and are being careful not to dilute or misrepresent EA's core ideas.)

## Key themes and priorities ... 'High value questions'

This project primarily aims at:&#x20;

1. **Robust and generalizable insights** that are relevant&#x20;

* across contexts and organizations,
* and to the Effective Altruism project and it's communication and messaging, in general.&#x20;

2\. **Outcomes** that are meaningful and relevant,

...not just for (e.g.) "raising a pot of money once", but for

* "**New strong EAs":** Getting people (more) interested and involved in EA ideas, actions, and the  community,
* **Key values and practices:** Getting people to consider and identify with key values and practices, such as making meaningful altruistic chocies, considering effectiveness and impact in doing so, strong analytical and epistemic practices, and broad (or carefully considered) moral circles.&#x20;
* And across a range of EA causes and groups (long-termist, global health and welfare, animals)&#x20;
