## **Our primary approach and goals**

We want to identify the most effective and scalable strategies for marketing EA and EA-adjacent ideas and actions. To do this, we believe that running real-world marketing trials and experiments with EA-aligned organizations will provide the best evidence to act upon. By systematically varying the messaging, framing, and contexts, we can map out '_what works better where'_.

_**We believe this approach is likely to be the most fruitful because:**_

1. Using naturally-occurring populations in real-world settings with meaningful costly choices and outcomes will lead to **more relevant findings**. In comparison to convenience samples of undergraduates or professional survey participants who are aware that they are doing a research study,  we anticipate greater:
   * _Internal validity:_ our results are less likely to be influenced by biases, such as acquiescence bias and hypothetical decision-making.
   * [_External generalizability/environmental relevance_](#user-content-fn-4)[^4]_:_ the context we are testing is similar or identical to the context we care about.
2. **We will "learn by doing"** by encountering unanticipated obstacles and learning about practical [implementation issues](../marketing-and-testing-opportunities-tools-tips/implementation-and-collecting-data-issues/) involved with advertising, promotion, and communication.
3. **We can share what we learn** with relevant EA organizations and audiences. They then can build on our findings, rather than having to repeatedly make mistakes themselves.
4. The trials _themselves_ should also have a **direct positive value in promoting EA.**
5. There is limited downside risk. We are generally not testing risky messages and are careful to avoid diluting or misrepresenting EA's core ideas.

## Key themes, priorities, and 'high-value questions'

_This project primarily aims at:_

1. **Robust and generalizable insights** that improve communication and messaging
2. **Meaningful and relevant long-run outcomes**, such as;
   * Creating **new, strong EAs** by getting people more interested and involved in EA ideas, actions, and the community
   * Having people consider and identify with **key values and practices**, such as making meaningful altruistic choices, considering effectiveness and impact in doing so, strong analytical and epistemic practices, and broad (or carefully considered) moral circles
   * [Substantial impactful **donation behavior** and choices](#user-content-fn-5)[^5]
3. **Across a range of EA causes and groups** (longtermism, global health, animal welfare)

In the document below ([EAMT: HVQs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jyn\_6aFt7z1kDo-6sHm9o\_ccPgEvig1b6c8OqPRH2eI/edit?usp=sharing)), we consider the shared goals, paths, and questions that are valid across organizations. Specifically, these are _**actionable and promising themes and projects**_ that can be implemented, measured, and communicated fluidly throughout the EA network.
