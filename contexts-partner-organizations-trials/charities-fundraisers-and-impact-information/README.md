[https://app.gitbook.com/u/WrM9GjKWCyRyoIjCKt7f0ddJwCr1](https://app.gitbook.com/u/WrM9GjKWCyRyoIjCKt7f0ddJwCr1 "mention")'s research (along with others) considers '_how do potential donors respond to (different presentations of) impact information'._ Reinstein and his academic partners ran several experiments, working with (and on) mainstream charities and fundraising platforms.
