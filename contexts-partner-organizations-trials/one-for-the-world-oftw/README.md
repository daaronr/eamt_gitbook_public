# One For the World (OftW)

## Background on OftW

<details>

<summary><em>How does OftW differ from others in this space?</em></summary>

Chloe: Focus on youth and university students at a pivotal point in their life

Accessible messaging, more of a starting point, less gatekeeping

David: 1% is 'more manageable' as a starting point perhaps

Luke: Narrow focus on one type of charities: global health and poverty

</details>

* OftW has a donor base of \~700 active donors, \~1650 pledged donors (who pledged but haven't started donating yet) and \~2000 lapsed donors.&#x20;
* 80% (of donors?) are in the USA
* Focus on global health charities
* They focus on donations to GiveWell charities ... but technically OftW pledgers can give to any 510c3

### Some key goals

**Reinstein/Lewars conversation notes**&#x20;

* **Activating** more donors who took the pledge at university, so their donations actually start;
* **Retaining** donors for longer once they activate;
* **Upselling** donors to give more over time (either more as a raw amount, e.g. 'keeping pace' at 1% of their income; or more as a percentage, e.g. 'graduating' to take the 10% GWWC pledge)
* **Acquiring** new donors with fewer touchpoints, e.g. via online advertising, via our website etc. (we currently get \~0 organic sign-ups)

## Who/what/how to test, learn, and adapt

### **Pipeline/groups/segments**

1. **Pledgers**
2. **Active donors, i.e., "Activated pledgers"** (Chloe is thinking of segments to this and how to appeal to them)
   1. Second tier -- people who have given each month for 12+ months; "Legacy donors" (DR: maybe 1x per year high-value donors should be in this group)
3. One-time donors (these may or may not be pledgers)
4. Cancelled
5. Payment failures

* Another group worth considering: 'pledge-curious supporters'

### **Goals/actions**

* 'Activating' Pledgers as donors (pledged but not donated)
* Active donors
  * Retain
  * Upsell (maybe only to the second tier?)
* Acquiring pledges, perhaps from a 'pledge-curious group'

### **Interested in knowing more about**

* Content -- expand our ability to tell stories about the beneficiaries
  * Ways to tell these stories
* Frequency (of comms with supporters)

### **Communications contexts**

* Platforms: Social media, email flows
* Telling stories in a corporate context

Typical audiences have been students and young professionals, but there is interest in corporate outreach

* Zoom and **lunchtime talks in corporate contexts** (How many? Seems very promising!)
  * How many people are activating/pledging following these lunch+learn?

## Typical donor journey:

> We are in the process of creating these homepages and setting up conversion tracking. As OFTW has \~0 organic sign ups currently, we are testing for a variety of conversion routes, including: \[Todo: clarify this]

* university campus, someone I like tells me they are involved in OftW, asks me to come along with free food
* at some point I take the pledge
* It is not a highly controlled process
* asking us (staff) a question by email
* joining a group call with others wanting to learn about effective donating (Kennan as dir. of chapter management)
* taking the pledge
* making a one-off donation

## Some rough numbers

650 active donors

1500 people in pipeline (pre-activation date)

750 new people a year are recruited... thinks it would be 2-2.5k

OFTW has a donor base of \~700 active donors,

\~1650 pledged donors (who pledged but haven't started donating yet) and

\~2000 lapsed donors.

## Ongoing/completed/upcoming experiments

### Email upsell emotion/impact message trial (see below)

### University experiment - redacted as being prepared

* Homepage message testing
* Activation trial
