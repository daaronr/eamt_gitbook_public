# University groups/promotion

## Goals and context

### **EA groups at elite universities and programs**

The main focus of this effort has been promoting and building EA groups, especially at elite and influential places (Ivy league etc)

1. Membership, participation, connection to EA orgs, markers of post-university involvement
2. Impacting career plans
3. (Possibly) influencing research and intellectual conversations at universities, including academia
4. Maybe focusing on particular programs and career paths

## CEA

## Open Philanthropy Fellowships

[The University Organizer Fellowship](https://openphilanthropy.org/focus/other-areas/university-organizer-fellowship), which provides funding for organizers and groups expenses for part-time and full-time organizers helping with student groups focused on effective altruism, longtermism, rationality, or other relevant topics at any university (not just focus universities). (Intended to replace the Campus Specialist and Campus Specialist Internship programs.)

> [The Century Fellowship](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/other-areas/century-fellowship), a selective 2-year program that gives resources and support (including $100K+/year in funding) to particularly promising people early in their careers who want to work in areas that could improve the long-term future. (Intended partially for particularly strong Campus Specialist applicants.)
