# Giving What We Can

[GWWC](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/) has updated their[ 2022 strategy](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/post/2022/03/public-strategy-update/). They are looking to significantly increase their marketing activity by producing videos, funding ads, and conducting systematic and robust research. As such there will be a large crossover between our work and theirs. This section highlights our collaborative efforts.

## Ideas and opportunities

We want to learn from existing work, run tests on the GWWC platform, and support research into this.

### **Stages of the funnel:**

1.  **Awareness & Consideration**&#x20;

    Increase casual visitors and raise curiosity&#x20;
2.  **Conversion & Acquisition**&#x20;

    Donate or pledge to donate
3.  **Retention**&#x20;

    Fulfill and report pledge
4.  **Advocacy**

    Promoting GWWC to others

### Some key questions

* “What should the call to action for the casual person in the funnel?”
* Testing all parts of funnel/pledge journey; website, welcome messages/welcome packages, reminders and thank-you's
