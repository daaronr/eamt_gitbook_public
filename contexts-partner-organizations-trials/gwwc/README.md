## Giving What We Can: ideas and opportunities

**Eager** to learn from existing work, run tests on GWWC platform, and support research into this.

### **Stages of the funnel:**

1. Awareness & Consideration (Curious, [casual visitors etc](../../partner-organizations-and-trials/gwwc/web-page-casual-visitors.md))
2. Conversion/acquisition (donate/pledge)
3. Retention (fulfill and report pledge)
4. ‘Advocacy’ (promoting GWWC to others)

### Some key questions

* “What should the call to action for the casual person in the funnel?”
* Testing all parts of site and funnel/pledge journey; web site, welcome messages/welcome packages, reminders and thank-you's
