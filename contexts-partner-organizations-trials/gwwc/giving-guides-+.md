# Giving guides - Facebook

Along with GWWC, we tested marketing and messaging themes on Facebook in their [Effective Giving Guide](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/giving-guide) Facebook Lead campaigns. Across four trials we compared the effectiveness of different types of (1) messages, (2) videos, and (3) targeted audiences.

A summary of this has been shared as a [post](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/nhbeKbwMgFKfrzLNb/marketing-messages-trial-for-gwwc-giving-guide-campaign) on the EA Forum:

This follows the [trial-reporting-template.md](../../marketing-and-testing-opportunities-tools-tips/trial-reporting-template.md "mention"), edited slightly for public reading.

We build the results and analysis transparently in the [EAMT Analysis web-book here.](https://daaronr.github.io/eamt\_data\_analysis/chapters/gwwc\_gg.html)

## Summary

**Context**: Facebook ads on a range of audiences&#x20;

... \[with text and rich content promoting effective giving and a "giving guide" -- links people to [a Giving What We Can page](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/giving-guide) asking for their email in exchange for the guide]

**Objective**: Test distinct [approaches to messaging,](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] aiming to get people to download our Giving Guide. A key comparison: ["Charity research facts" vs. "cause focus".](#user-content-fn-2)[^2]

Also informative about costs and the 'value of targeting different groups' in this context.



**Key findings:**

* **The cost of an email address** via a Facebook campaign during Giving Season was [**as low as $8.00** across campaigns](#user-content-fn-3)[^3].
* “_**Only 3% of people give effectively**_,” seems to be an effective message for generating link clicks and email addresses, relative to the other messages.
* Lookalike and animal rights audiences seem to be the most promising audiences.
* Demographics are _not_ very predictive on a per-$ basis.



#### **Key caveats**

**Specificity and interpretation:** All comparisons are not for 'audiences of similar composition' but for 'the best audience Facebook could find to show the ads, within each group, according to its algorithm'. Thus, differences in performance may combine 'better targeting' with 'better performance on the targeted group'. See our [discussion of the 'divergent delivery' problem HERE](https://effective-giving-marketing.gitbook.io/untitled/methodological-discussion/splits-randomization/facebook-split-testing-etc). I.e., we can make statements about "what works better on Facebook in this context and maybe similar contexts", [but not about "which audience, as defined, is more receptive"](#user-content-fn-4)[^4], as the targeting _within_ each audience may differ in unobserved ways.&#x20;

**The outcome** is 'click to download the giving guide'.

[^1]: Worked with a creative agency to develop a set of animated video ads, with differing texts Note this had several 'versions' during the campaign (see 'Test 1 - Test 4').

[^2]: Previously, and in Grace's presentation, these were called "emotional and factual" approaches.

[^3]: And we believe it could be lower with more/better targeting

[^4]: Nor about "which message works better on a particular comparable audience" (for the same reason).
