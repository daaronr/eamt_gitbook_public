# Giving guides - Facebook(+)

## Summary

**Context**: Facebook ads on a range of audiences

**Objective**: Test two different approaches (emotional and factual) messaging in order to get people to download our Giving Guide.

Worked with a creative agency to develop a set of animated video ads: Differing texts

Also informative about costs and the value of targeting in this context

Note this had several 'versions' during the campaign (see 'Test 1 - Test 4'



**Key findings:**

* The cost of an email address via a Facebook campaign during Giving Season was as low as $8.00 dollars across campaigns but could be lower with more targeting.
* “Only 3% of people give effectively,” seems to be an effective message for generating link click and email addresses vs. the other messages.
* Lookalike and animal rights audiences seem the most promising audiences.
* Demographics are not very predictive on a per-$ basis.
