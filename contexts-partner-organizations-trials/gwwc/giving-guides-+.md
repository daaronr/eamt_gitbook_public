<summary>Notes on content/building this</summary>

This follows the [trial-reporting-template.md](../../marketing-and-testing-opportunities-tools-tips/trial-reporting-template.md "mention"), edited slightly for public reading.

We are building the results and analysis in a  transparent way; directly importing the data and doing our own analyses ... within the [EAMT Analysis web-book here.](https://daaronr.github.io/eamt\_data\_analysis/chapters/gwwc\_gg.html)

## Summary

**Context**: Facebook ads on a range of audiences.

**Objective**: Test two different approaches (emotional and factual) to messaging in order to get people to download our Giving Guide.

Worked with a creative agency to develop a set of animated video ads: Differing texts

Also informative about costs and the value of targeting in this context

Note this had several 'versions' during the campaign (see 'Test 1 - Test 4'



**Key findings:**

* The cost of an email address via a Facebook campaign during Giving Season was as low as $8.00 dollars across campaigns but could be lower with more targeting.
* “Only 3% of people give effectively,” seems to be an effective message for generating 'link clicks' and 'email addresses' relative to the other messages.
* Lookalike and animal rights audiences seem the most promising audiences.
* Demographics are not very predictive on a per-$ basis.

Caveat: The results&#x20;
