# Legacies/bequests (exploring)

## Key ideas

* "Boomer" wealth will be passed on to heirs soon ... huge amounts
* Bequest fundraising seen to have high-ROI
* Some psych/econ/legal reasons why people might be particular willing to donate from their 'leftover assets at death'
* Some initiatives exist (see below), 'Oftw/Gwwc/TLYCS' might plug in to these
* Reinstein has some ideas about facilitating negotiations among parents and children (legates and legatees) to help discover a shared interest in effective pledging/giving&#x20;
* Consider writing up an MVP and doing a trial in Spring 2022?

## Key existing initiatives and tools&#x20;

### Pledges&#x20;

("The Giving pledge")

#### ["Generation pledge"](https://www.generationpledge.org)

\> To join Generation Pledge, inheritors must commit to: 1 Donate at least 10% of their inheritance to effective causes within the first 5 years of inheriting 2 Mobilise their financial, social, career, and political capital to generate the greatest impact, before and after inheriting

[@Peter Wildeford](https://rethinkpriorities.slack.com/team/U019CL8FK4H) Yes! Generation Pledge is a community for UHNW individuals who pledge to give at least 10% of their future inheritance. The community incentivizes and advises them on how to have the most impact with both their financial and their social capital (connections, easy access to important people, etc.). They have 70 members (people who took the pledge) from all over the globe, amounting to ca. $1.5B in pledged money. I'd say that max. 10% of their members are EA-aligned right now. \[DR: what about the 'effective' part it?]  The pledge is a social commitment but not a legally binding one.

* Jack has some contact with this ... trying to bring them on an EA journey, how to be as persuasive as possible.&#x20;
* Rival --  "Resource Generation'  -- not effective



#### ["Legacies now"](https://legacies-now.de/en):&#x20;

\>  I think their name was just inspired from the idea of philanthropists who want to "leave a legacy to the world", so the org wants to help them do that soon and effectively. But I haven't seen them work on bequest fundraising. Their target audience are philanthropists giving >1M per year every year these days.

DR: Germany-based. Its a bit hard to see from  their website exactly what they are doing/focused on



## Misc notes; conversation with Jack Lewars

Jack: "ROI" on bequest funding in UK is much higher than other events, he has heard.

Interested in getting an MVP off the ground, not through OFTW.. will people give this a go?  Possibly a 'one-off' thing with OfTW. Some value in offering a menu of options.&#x20;

EA may be a bit too impatient for longer-term projects of fundraising (ironically ofbecause  longtermism)... bequests is a long-game

FP 'gets around this' because of their legal lock..&#x20;

Need to have a vehicle -- and a fund that dynamically determines where it goes&#x20;



## **Going forward plans/to do**

* DR to do research
  * what orgs and tools exist and what is missing or needs pushingâ€™&#x20;
  * what the applied research says .. about approaches to encouraging bequests
* JL can volunteer some time, with other volunteers to put together an MVP
* possibly -- go out in the  Spring, trial  with some push ... GW, LTFF, climate funds, look for the result
* if it goes well, worth considering incubation at Charity Entrpreneurship&#x20;
