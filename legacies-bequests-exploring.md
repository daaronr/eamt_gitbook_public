\> To join Generation Pledge, inheritors must commit to: 1 Donate at least 10% of their inheritance to effective causes within the first 5 years of inheriting 2 Mobilise their financial, social, career, and political capital to generate the greatest impact, before and after inheriting

[@Peter Wildeford](https://rethinkpriorities.slack.com/team/U019CL8FK4H) Yes! Generation Pledge is a community for UHNW individuals who pledge to give at least 10% of their future inheritance. The community incentivizes and advises them on how to have the most impact with both their financial and their social capital (connections, easy access to important people, etc.). They have 70 members (people who took the pledge) from all over the globe, amounting to ca. $1.5B in pledged money. I'd say that max. 10% of their members are EA-aligned right now.  The pledge is a social commitment but not a legally binding one.\


* ["Legacies now"](https://legacies-now.de/en):&#x20;

\>  I think their name was just inspired from the idea of philanthropists who want to "leave a legacy to the world", so the org wants to help them do that soon and effectively. But I haven't seen them work on bequest fundraising. Their target audience are philanthropists giving >1M per year every year these days.
