description: How the gitbook sections are organized
---

# ðŸ“• Gitbook content overview

**Overview of grouped sections ... the basic idea:**

* [Preamble](./): a quick take
* Explaining the [organization](broken-reference) of our [team](organization-and-overview/our-team-and-resources/) and [our tools](organization-and-overview/how-this-gitbook-works/)
* [What we're trying to do and why](overview-ea-forum-post.md) (embedded posts),



_****_[_**Contexts/environments, specific plans for trials in these contexts**_](broken-reference)****

1. Cross-organization plans
2. By each organization
   1. Background on the organization and the environments within
   2. Plans and progress on trials within each
3. T[emplate for reporting](contexts-environments-plans-tests/trial-reporting-template.md#concise-reporting-template) trials and progress

\
[_**Implementation issues**_](broken-reference)_, 'practical' issues:_ focusing on 'testing marketing', but also relevant to  'doing marketing'&#x20;



_****_[_**Research Design and Methodology**_](broken-reference)****

_The idea:_ We discuss these issues and separate sections and _link to them_ when discussing specific trials

* [Qualitative design issues](methodological-discussion/qualitative-design-issues.md)
* [Quantitative design and method issues](methodological-discussion/experimental-design-methods-issues.md)



_****_[_**Background/previous work/framework (context, digging deeper, research links)**_](broken-reference)_****_

* _****_[What is known/models of effective giving](background/models-theories-psychological-norms.md),
* [Principles and theories behind potential trials](background/tools-and-trials-overview/tools-interventions-principles.md)
* [Tools and trials](organization-and-overview/broken-reference/): specific things we want to do/test; (partly) grouped by 'outcomes' (esp. [effectiveness](organization-and-overview/broken-reference/) & [commitment](organization-and-overview/broken-reference/))
