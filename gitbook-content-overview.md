# ðŸ“• Gitbook content overview

**Overview of grouped sections ... the basic idea:**

* [Preamble](./)
* Explain [organization](broken-reference) of the [team](organization-and-overview/our-team-and-resources/) and [our tools](https://github.com/daaronr/effective\_giving\_market\_testing/tree/76fd750340efe8794ed505cc87e8e0905ddeb98e/organization-and-overview/how-this-gitbook-works/README.md)
* "Background:
  * [What we're trying to do and why](organization-and-overview/broken-reference/),
  * [What is known/models of effective giving](background/models-theories-psychological-norms.md),
  * P[rinciples and theories behind potential trials](background/tools-and-trials-overview/tools-interventions-principles.md)
* [Tools and trials](organization-and-overview/broken-reference/): specific things we want to do/test; (partly) grouped by 'outcomes' (esp. [effectiveness](organization-and-overview/broken-reference/) & [commitment](organization-and-overview/broken-reference/))
* Contexts/environments, specific plans for trials in these contexts
  1. Cross-organization plans
  2. By each organization
     1. Background on the organization and the environments within
     2. Plans and progress on trials within each
  3. T[emplate for reporting](contexts-environments-plans-tests/trial-reporting-template.md#concise-reporting-template) trials and progress
* [Implementation issues](organization-and-overview/broken-reference/), 'practical' issues
*   Methodology

    _Let's link to this in other sections not rehash each debate in multiple places_

    * [Qualitative design issues](methodological-discussion/qualitative-design-issues.md)
    * [Quantitative design and method issues](methodological-discussion/experimental-design-methods-issues.md)
