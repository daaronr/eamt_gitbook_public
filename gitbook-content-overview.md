# üìï Content overview

## **Introduction**

Our [mission](./), [what we are trying to do and why](overview-ea-forum-post.md), [most recent updates](broken-reference/), and the organization of [our team](our-team-and-resources.md)

{% hint style="info" %}
For a data-driven dynamic document covering (some of) our trials & evidence see [HERE.](https://daaronr.github.io/eamt\_data\_analysis/chapters/gwwc\_gg.html)
{% endhint %}

## Five Key Sections

### 1) [Partner Organizations and Trials](contexts-partner-organizations-trials/section-introduction.md) ü§ù

In this section of the gitbook, you will find **reports of the trials we have run** with organizations, including Giving What We Can and One For the World. (More detailed statistical analysis is presented in the dynamic document [here](https://daaronr.github.io/eamt\_data\_analysis/)). We include background information on each organization and its priorities for testing.

### 2) [Marketing & Testing: Opportunities, Tools, Tips](marketing-and-testing-opportunities-tools-tips/trial-reporting-template.md) ü™ß

Here we share tools to implement planned trials, as well as tips relevant to 'doing marketing'. We answer questions like how to set up campaigns and track outcomes on various platforms. See especially "[Implementing ads](marketing-and-testing-opportunities-tools-tips/implementation-and-collecting-data-issues/)..." (on Facebook etc)... and "[Collecting data](marketing-and-testing-opportunities-tools-tips/collecting-data-trial-outcomes/)..."

### 3) [Research Design and Methodology](methodological-discussion/section-introduction-wip.md) üé®

We discuss qualitative and quantitative research design and methodology issues that are relevant to the trials we are running. Pages in this section will be linked in reports when relevant to a particular trial.

### 4) [Profiling and Segmentation Project](profiling-and-segmentation/section-introduction.md) üßÆ

Our profiling project aims to help better understand what sorts of people are amenable to EA-related ideas and to taking EA-favored actions.

### **5)** [**(In)effective Altruistic Choices: Review of Theory and Evidence**](background/section-introduction.md)  üìã

We've done a  review of existing literature: to inform the trials we are running, and to identify important research topics. This includes [What is known/models of effective giving](background/models-theories-psychological-norms.md) and [Principles and theories behind potential trials](background/tools-and-trials-overview/tools-interventions-principles.md).

### You can find references, tech support, and other resources in the [appendix](appendix/how-this-gitbook-works/).


## What is this 'Gitbook' meant for?

The three key aims of this [**public gitbook**](https://effective-giving-marketing.gitbook.io/untitled/) are to:

1. **Convey** **who we are, what have accomplished, and the scope of our work** to funders, people in the broader EA community, and people not yet involved in the project who would be interested in joining

2. **Share tools and knowledge with** **people in the EA/global priorities community who will apply it to their work.** We are building a knowledge base. Content in the public gitbook can inform and support a diverse set of projects (i.e., implementing marketing campaigns, fundraising initiatives, academic research)

3. **Seek feedback on our work**. This includes technical and industry feedback on implementation and academic expertise (literature reviews and frameworks to consider, methodology, and experimental design).
